The outdoor one was always dead never saw a car in the drive thru. But the inside one had a line as long as hungry jack's, almost like people not wanting to wait in line decided to go there which then formed a line. There is a Chinese place, Maccas, KFC and a bunch of smaller food places in the same food court aswell. But always a line at red rooster.",

This in turn is suppose to force your bank to lower your interest rate to 2.5% and you then use that extra 0.25% to go out and spend or invest it to try to stimulate the economy.\n>how this affects me?\nUnless you have a mortgage or a bank loan, you're not really going to feel the impact immediately and even then, that's if the banks pass the rate cut."

Why are we not outraged at them? Many, many other countries also imprison gays and we still have ties with them. What about countries accused of war crimes and genocide? \nThe only thing in this article that makes it any different is that a well known highly disliked conservative Australian has helped in the process of setting it up.",

This \"consulate\" is not recognised by DFAT and is self designated. Notice that the premier or any ministers of the government aren't present. The consulate will be nothing more than a phone number and a part time receptionist and given Barundi's importance and relevance, I doubt there will be much for them to do."

Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.\nBut if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. If they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. Bhagat Singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter.",

      "reply": "Pata nahi. Hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. Such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in India - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. Rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for Hindu appeasement. \nSo much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win. \nRSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. \nRSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus."

I loved going going to an outback school, we ended up in dalby. Guys did 'lappies' in the main street. Underage drinking at Marys pub. (not condoning it) Cigarettes will kill you,  MGF, Regurgitator, powderfinger Recovery, custard. nirvana, foo fighters, Pearl jam, yes spice girls lol. Superjesus was my first concert when I was 18 and living with friends in the late 90s. Livid festival.  I used to mosh! Holy crap lol. Mates I made.The balmy house parties in suburban Brisbane at uni. $1 drinks.  my flatmate watching dawsons creek, going to Lions games with her. Jason Akimanis and Luke Power.\nmost of the 90s I was at school though. In dalby I remember the Great Locust Plague of 1994. And the mouse plague of '93. National anthem at school assembly. heartbreak High, Drazic, X files, and my friend and I used to make cheesy Mulder and Scully birthday cards. Jimeoin and Bobs cooking show. Aussie comedy. four weddings and a funeral. Listening to Lawsie on the radio with my dad on holidays. riding around town on my bike, dropping in on mates. art class. it was the only one I really liked I think, and English, drama. I remember backchatting teachers. Cross Country runs in 35 degree heat. Celing fans. Lynx deorderant. chatting with my best mate outside school for ages about Ab Fab. we gossipped about teachers like Mrs Brown 'how now brownnn cow' as we watched her drive off in her \"Toorak tractor\" we used to say. (its ok, bitchiness was deserved),internet got connected in my house when I was in grade 12, I thought it was the biggest deal to be able to chat to a rando across the world.  school camp at Tallebudgera where apparently everyone isn't scared of heights except me. a bat flying into our cabin. my friend screaming. bahaha. Electric blue streaks in my hair. (18) because I thought that was cool ha. qcs exams. excitement about moving out. the last week of school.  yearbooks and saying goodbye. two girls wore the same dress to the year 12 formal and it was awkward.  schoolies. sorry for the punctuation, good thread.",

And I put the Apple watch my sister gave me on craigslist for free to pick up. (Who's gonna use that trash LMAO) So my sister saw me do that. She got angry at me like what the hell? So as the train came up to the platform I pushed her in front of it.\nI am now faced with charge of murder, like wtf she got what she deserved.

Their transport would be arranged by the army, who'd take charge of hosing them down between visits.   \nThe Civil Defense would be in charge of distributing supplies like anti-inflammatories and food, fresh water etc.\nAGS would take care of civil order and all limits on overtime for all branches would be lifted. \nThat's a broad-brush look at how we might tackle things, and while we're honestly not familiar with this type of regime and it'd be a very odd time I think on the whole Irish people would help pitch in and be helpful."

We don’t want what’s happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we’re a remarkably self sufficient nation. Have a pantry and have enough; but let’s not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours. \nThat being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. \nRemember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food. \nRemember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren’t expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here’s the thing, you probably don’t. \nWhat you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. If it runs out in stores because people are being Chicken Littles, vinegar kills 80% of germs. As someone else said, toilet paper is great and you’ll miss it when you don’t have it. Garbage bags too. \nPrepare for possible power outages, the same way we did for the bushfires. Get a power bank for $20 from Kmart (and a back up one if you really can’t stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio. Batteries as well for LED lights and a radio. Pillar candles or tea lights as a back up and some matches.",

      "post": "Making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. Being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. I agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. It’s very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. Just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.\nOn the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, I’ve gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once I find out he’s straight. Yet there is a general sense of unease when I meet new straight guys, I think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they don’t think I’m in any way coming on to them at all, I would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. So baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because I’m over-compensating for them knowing I’m gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything I may do or say.\nClearly I’m reading a lot into it here, but I ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. The friends I have made as an adult have been through work and one guy I did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. \nWhatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. Flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. I think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.\nInstead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great Shia La Beouf; “just do it!”",
      "reply": "Completely understand your sentiment. It's tough. You're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. Very frustrating. \nAbsolutely, I'm loyal to a fault and if I make plans with someone I will always stick to them unless I'm sick or something. Very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you."

We can safely say the USA govt were incompetent in its prevention at least, and had a knowing hand in it at worse. \nThe plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. \nAll camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. Any footage you see online is state sponsored. \nThe Air Force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 9/11 by Dick Cheney (The devil) himself \nProof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. \nThe third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. \n(I’ve been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. He’s no where to be found today. \nI hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. They’re just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. \nThe troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data.",

Nobody noticed any fallacies? And why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? The thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and I guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? What kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored."

      "post": "The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. \nIf you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",
      "reply": "Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. \nI'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. \nHowever, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. \nI've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S."

Probably a sign I can actually drive, and I ought to sack off my current driving instructor for a more patient one - I'm sick of being shouted at, and it's got to the point where I jump if anyone in the passenger seat moves or raises their voice. Luckily enough, mine's away for two weeks now, so it gives me the opportunity to call around. \nOff for a carvery in a bit with the twin and a friend from school, which I'm looking forward to. Since I started my new job, my commute has tripled, and I don't have as much time with them as I'd like, so it's always nice for a catch-up.",

The hse can't keep these secrets not only because it's impossible since we'll find out anyway but also and more importantly we have a right to know more details about threats to our families so we can make our own decisons..\nFor example, I needed to know what school this was last night because if it had been near me I wouldn't have sent my kid  to pre-school today as a precaution. That's my choice given my own families circumstances. But I need accurate info in order to make that choice.

Apply the new stuff over the old stuff as a layer.\nYou have to do this until the summer comes. ~~Or Shivraathri [Feb 20/21, 2020].~~ This process needs to be continued right through summer into the rainy season, and you have to wash it off in the first rain.\nAnd you have to go about your business.

You have to be able to show you earn enough that you can pay rent and save significantly as well as afford to live. So they know you can keep paying if interest rates go up.\nIts just they also need a 10-20% deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.\nIn fairness both are reasonable rules.\nThe problem is not the lending rules, its the price of property being entirely unaffordable to begin with and if you loosen the rules it will just drive prices higher again.\nDevelopers not building affordable properties on desirable land when they can build higher margin luxury properties instead is the problem. Its up to the planning authorities to control what gets build where and insist on a higher proportion of higher density affordable properties being built in these developments."

Just put out a video of global isolation and containment where he spoke about a paper in The Lancet. How to best control the outbreak by isolation of cases and isolation of the contacts of said cases. The R0 of Covid-19 is 2.6, meaning for every case, that person will infect 2.6 and so and so forth. \nSo basically the paper is saying the only way to contain this is to slow the process as much as possible and completely isolate cases and contacts. Imo we’ve already fucked it with the way we’ve handled our first case. In a small country like ours it should be easier to contain but if not acted upon properly it can spread faster. I think we are gonna be at Italy levels in the coming weeks.\nI’m not trying to fear monger because the majority of us should be fine but it’s so frustrating to see it not taken seriously by people. Look at Vietnam and how they have handled it, looks like they have stamped it out fast and actually took serious measures to stop it spreading from the get go.",

If a friend opens his door holding a gallon of milk, I know he’s in the middle of regretting the night before. My ex and I broke our refrigerators middle shelf because of the combined weight of his 2 gallons of 2% and my 2 gallons of whole milk that we bought weekly. (No, neither of us were or are obese. Lol)\nI once laughed with a friend of mine at his Dad for offering his deck builders milk while they worked in 90°f (32.2°c) heat. 3 guys took him up on his offer, choosing it over Gatorade. \nIn shop class in highschool, I built a 1/2 gallon milk container holder with a handle for my Nanna because she was struggling to lift them anymore.

Il timore, fondatissimo se si guardano i precedenti (da McGovern a Corbyn, inb4 ma questa volta è diverso!!!!!) e se si studiano attentamente i sondaggi (Sanders non riuscirà MAI a mobilitare tutti i giovani che gli servono, e un candidato radicale sicuramente porterà alle urne tantissimi moderati e conservatori che altrimenti starebbero a casa), è che candidare Sanders significhi rieleggere Trump.",

E che cazz'è siamo tornati nel far west?",
      "reply": "Partiamo dalla premessa che, grossomodo, sono d'accordo con te: c'è gente che considera la Bossi-Fini il quinto vangelo, piuttosto che una porcata immane che crea un ciclo di \"sono criminali perché immigrati perché criminali perché immigrati perché criminali...\". L'immigrazione clandestina andrebbe controllata - perché chiariamoci, uno stato ha il diritto di sapere chi c'è entro i suoi confini - ma che sia considerata un crimine al pari di una rapina ha poco senso.\nDetto ciò, la situazione che si sta svolgendo in questo momento è limpida quanto il fango: Erdogan sta svuotando le carceri nel flusso di persone che manda al confine, mandandoci letteralmente criminali. Mi pare abbastanza palese che voglia l'ondata di xenofobia risultante, perché la cosa gli permette di continuare a usare l'immigrazione come spauracchio per ottenere vantaggi.\nÈ per questo motivo che bisognerebbe tirar fuori la diplomazia di stampo Roosevelt - Teddy, non Franklin Delano: taglio istantaneo di tutti i rapporti diplomatici, militari, e commerciali, pattugliamento feroce delle acque territoriali greche e cipriote - con particolare attenzione a pattugliare le acque \"libiche\" e \"nord-cipriote\" - riconoscimento dello stato curdo entro i confini turchi, e, a seconda di quanto ci si sente randellosi, distruzione di quel foruncolo che è Cipro Nord. Sputare letteralmente in faccia a Erdogan sarebbe un bonus."

Devi sperimentare finché non trovi la tua soluzione ottimale.\nDetto questo, io ho iniziato tanto tempo fa con il wet shaving a lama singola (i rasoi di sicurezza di cui parla anche /u/Ilnormanno). Devo dire che, almeno per i miei esperimenti, quel che fa più differenza sul risultato finale e sull'irritazione NON è la lama singola invece che multipla, ma il fatto di usare un sapone da barba montato ad acqua invece che la schiuma da barba in bomboletta, che non idrata la pelle ma lubrifica soltanto.\nWild suggestion: prova a raderti usando il normale sapone per le mani. Se ottieni meno irritazione di prima, probabilmente quella del sapone e pennello è la tua strada.\nIl rasoio elettrico anche su di me è super irritante.\nLe lozioni aftershave profumate sono irritanti. Prenditi l'allume di rocca che costa tipo un euro (occhio che brucia!) oppure la pasta fissan o robe simili.\nPer quanto riguarda il momento, la cosa migliore è radersi DOPO la doccia calda. Se non si incastra coi tuoi ritmi quotidiani, asciugamano inzuppato di acqua molto calda in faccia per 2-3 minuti prima di raderti. Poi dopo la rasatura acqua fredda per chiudere i pori.",

      "post": "Sono asiatica e mi hanno mandata a casa. \nCapisco che il discorso coronavirus sia delicato e ci sia un malumore generale. \nVolevo però raccontare ciò che mi è successo stamattina e chiedere le vostre opinioni a riguardo. Soprattutto se sono io troppo sensibile o se è normale che mi senta discriminata. \nStudio per diventare tecnico di laboratorio e oggi sono tornata in ospedale per fare il tirocinio. In questi ultimi giorni, nella mia città, sono stati scoperti dei malati di covid19 e sono attualmente ricoverati nell'ospedale universitario che frequento.\nPresentandomi alla coordinatrice del reparto trasfusionale, mi è stato chiesto se fossi raffreddata perché tiravo su con il naso. Premetto che ho sempre avuti fastidi al naso da anni perché fumo e sono anche lievemente allergica ai gatti... E io ho un gatto. Inoltre, la mattina quando esco, l'aria secca mi fa lacrimare gli occhi e di conseguenza mi cola il naso. Oltre a questo, sono anche ansiosa, mi sudano le mani e anche le secrezione nasale viene stimolata. Comunque, sono cose che riesco a controllare bene soprattutto se mi tranquillizzo oppure mi passo un fazzoletto come gesto più che altro di rassicurazione.\nQuindi le spiegai che si, ho \"il raffreddore\" ma che è una situazione cronica che mi porto da anni. In realtà non è nemmeno raffreddore, non ho tosse, catarro, non starnutisco e non ho la febbre.\nLei però non era tanto convinta e mi disse che avrebbe spostato il tirocinio alla settimana prossima per questo coronavirus in giro.\nLe chiesi se voleva farmi un tampone, così ci leviamo il dubbio e io posso proseguire con i miei impegni scolastici.\nLei mi disse che non potevo fare il tirocinio per la tranquillità dei pazienti (immunocompromessi) e il personale.\nAlla fine le dissi che sono d'accordo di tornare la prossima settimana, ma il mio \"raffreddore\" sarà ancora presente, perché è cronica.\nA questo punto mi risponde che sarebbe più tranquilla se passassero 7 giorni di incubazione per precauzione. \nQuello che mi da fastidio, è che io non ho sintomi. Va bene, il covid19 può essere asintomatica, ma a sto punto, sia io che la coordinatrice e tutti quelli che lavorano all'ospedale possiamo essere messi sullo stesso livello di pericolosità verso gli immunocompromessi.\nSento che la sua decisione sia stata guidata dalla prima reazione che ha provocato i miei tratti asiatici e dalla paura. Non mi è sembrato per niente una decisione obiettiva, anche perché nell'ospedale in questione non si sono adottate misure così estreme.\nProprio ieri, l'unico evento che può essere considerato ad alto rischio di contagio, ho avuto una lezione con un medico che bazzica nel reparto in cui sono ricoverati i pazienti affetti da covid19. Infatti, faceva avanti e indietro tra l'aula e il reparto. Ha starnutito un paio di volte rassicurandoci che non fosse covid19 il suo.\nNon mi è sembrato che il personale ospedaliero fosse dotato di mascherine, almeno non nei corridoi e al bar, tanto meno nei corridoi dei laboratori del reparto trasfusionale. \nNon mi importa lo spostamento del tirocinio, è più una scocciatura che altro, ma mi ha deluso il trattamento. Mi sento infetta e sto pensando di richiedere un tampone covid19 al mio medico, per far prevalere il mio diritto di essere trattata come gli altri o per lo meno, se risultasse positivo, avere una giusta motivazione di stare a casa per una settimana.\nPer me, l'allontanamento dal reparto implica un sospetto di covid19 e se non sono adeguata per stare lì, non posso nemmeno andare all'ospedale dove ci sono altri individui deboli nei corridoi, nelle scale, alla fermata. Non dovrei fare la fila al supermercato con gli anziani nelle vicinanze o semplicemente andare in giro a diffondere. \nPoi metti caso che non ho niente adesso, ma mi becco il covid la settimana prossima stando in reparto? \nForse, se mi fossi spiegata meglio alla coordinatrice, tranquillizzandola sul fatto che è solo muco acquoso e niente di più, forse adesso starei stoccando le sacche di sangue nel frigo. Forse avrei attirato le antipatie del personale e dei pazienti che vedono giusto giusto una cinese che passeggia tranquillamente nebulizzando coronavirus nell'ambiente. \nChe poi non sono nemmeno cinese.",

Mangio e mi metto sul divano, o al pc. Ogni tanto vado in palestra ma non riesco a stare constante nemmeno con quello. Dovrei studiare e scrivere la tesi ma non riesco, mi manca completamente la voglia. Anche io volevo imparare qualche linguaggio di programmazione, ho imparato HTML e CSS (non proprio programmazione ma vebbe) ho fatto 2 siti carini e bom, ho lasciato perdere. Ora sono in fissa con imparare a produrre musica, ma purtroppo credo che mi stuferó anche di questo tra qualche giorno/settimana... \nNon so come uscire da questo circolo vizioso. Quindi non ho consigli, ma ti capisco ahah",

Dietmar Hopp est de là bas, milliardaire car un des fondateurs de SAP, une des plus grosses entreprises d'ERP au monde. Il a racheté le club dans les années 90 puis a injecté progressivement du cash. \n\"Dopé\" par ces investissements, le club a monté tous les échelons pour finir parmi les meilleurs actuels de Bundesliga.\nOr, là où ça passe easy dans d'autres pays, en Allemagne, c'est mal vu. Les investissements massifs de personnes physiques ou morales dans les clubs sont limités, l'endettement des clubs est très limité aussi. Si je me trompe pas, le Bayern finit globalement ses exercices comptables dans le vert ou à l'équilibre, là où d'autres cadors européens se permettent de finir dans le rouge et de laisser des milliardaires éponger, ou d'accumuler de la dette auprès des grandes banques. Globalement il y a cette idée que la thune des gros clubs vient des succès durement acquis au fil de longues années, et non l'inverse. Dans ce contexte, ben forcément le club insignifiant amateur d'une ville minuscule qui se fait racheter par un milliardaire et passe tous les échelons pour finir au top en Bundesliga, c'est mal vu.\nBref et comme en plus les ultras sont pas toujours fût-fût ils ont dégainé une banderole le traitant de fils de pute pendant le match samedi."

J'ai un mois et demi pour payer ma partie du programme d'échange, et mon boulot actuel me donne que 5 heures (donc à peu près $35 - $40) par semaine. En avoir un deuxième m'aiderait énormément à amasser tout cet argent. Mais les examens de fin d'année approchent, et je ne sais pas s'il faut perdre plus de mon temps libre ?\nPar ailleurs, je me sens de plus en plus comme je n'ai pas de \"chez moi\" ou de pays qui m'appartient, et c'est vraiment bizarre comme sentiment. Je n'ai jamais mis les pieds en France donc évidemment je ne suis pas encore française, mais je ne dirais pas qu'ici est \"mon pays\" non plus. C'est un problème qui augmente depuis plusieurs mois en fait et j'en ai déjà parlé un peu ici, mais bon, je voulais en reparler. Pas trop agréable, cette sensation d'être apatride... puis maintenant il y a même des fois où je vois quelque chose de génial qui se passe en France, je pense \"ah je suis fière de mon pays !\" et ensuite je dois me rappeler que c'est pas le mien.\nCe sera quand même long, un an !",

Ça exprime le doute et la subjectivité, en gros. Exs : Y a-t-il quelqu'un qui connaisse le coin ? Je crois qu'il n'y a personne qui connaisse/ je ne crois pas que quelqu'un connaisse le coin.\nEt comme quelqu'un l'a souligné, la notion qu'un pays \"appartienne\" à quelqu'un sonne un peu bancale, on comprend mais c'est pas terrible. \"Un pays qui soit le mien\" c'est peut-être mieux :)"

Ça m'étonnerait qu'en France, même si on payait le coût réel d'une prise en charge a l'hosto de notre propre poche on arriverait à ces échelles de prix Est-ce un racket organisé ? Un dysfonctionnement ? Je pensé au  logement, à laggro,  à ces autres choses essentielle à la vie d'un Humain qui n'ont pas l'air la bas aussi impactées. Pour la santé c'est putain de dystopique.

Face à un virus jusqu'alors inconnu, la Chine a déployé l'effort de confinement de la maladie peut-être le plus ambitieux, le plus agile et le plus agressif de l'histoire. L'utilisation rigoureuse et sans compromis par la Chine de mesures non pharmaceutiques pour contenir la transmission du virus COVID-19 dans de multiples contextes fournit des enseignements essentiels pour la réponse mondiale. Cette réponse de santé publique plutôt unique et sans précédent en Chine a permis d'inverser l'escalade des cas à la fois dans le Hubei, où la transmission communautaire a été généralisée, et dans les provinces d'importation, où des groupes familiaux semblent avoir été à l'origine de l'épidémie\".\n>\"Une grande partie de la communauté mondiale n'est pas encore prête, dans les esprits et sur le plan matériel, à mettre en œuvre les mesures qui ont été employées pour contenir la COVID-19 en Chine. Ce sont les seules mesures dont il est actuellement prouvé qu'elles interrompent ou minimisent les chaînes de transmission chez l'homme. Ces mesures reposent sur une surveillance extrêmement proactive pour détecter immédiatement les cas, un diagnostic très rapide et l'isolement immédiat des cas, un suivi rigoureux et la mise en quarantaine des contacts étroits, ainsi qu'un degré exceptionnellement élevé de compréhension et d'acceptation de ces mesures par la population\"."

On parle de 75% contre ~15% pour une voiture à gaz, même en produisant de l'électricité  à partir de gaz, il y aurait un gain d'efficacité qui réduirait de moitié les GES en plus de pouvoir permettre de faire de la capture de carbone.\nLa ou je suis d'accord avec toi c'est le problème qu'on a en Amérique d'absolument tout construire en fonction de se promener en auto en ville.

En avoir un deuxième m'aiderait énormément à amasser tout cet argent. Mais les examens de fin d'année approchent, et je ne sais pas s'il faut perdre plus de mon temps libre ?\nPar ailleurs, je me sens de plus en plus comme je n'ai pas de \"chez moi\" ou de pays qui m'appartient, et c'est vraiment bizarre comme sentiment. Je n'ai jamais mis les pieds en France donc évidemment je ne suis pas encore française, mais je ne dirais pas qu'ici est \"mon pays\" non plus. C'est un problème qui augmente depuis plusieurs mois en fait et j'en ai déjà parlé un peu ici, mais bon, je voulais en reparler. Pas trop agréable, cette sensation d'être apatride... puis maintenant il y a même des fois où je vois quelque chose de génial qui se passe en France, je pense \"ah je suis fière de mon pays !\" et ensuite je dois me rappeler que c'est pas le mien.\nCe sera quand même long, un an !",

      "post": "Merci pour cet \"élément de contexte\".\nPlusieurs choses : déjà, le \"journaliste\" est bien journaliste. Il est pigiste, notamment pour RT France (c'est indiqué dans sa bio twitter). D'après le CIDJ, Wikipédia, et Studyrama, un pigiste est un journaliste rémunéré à la tâche, statut permettant de collaborer avec un ou plusieurs médias, et ayant les mêmes droits que les journalistes mensualisés depuis 1974.\nMaintenant que l'on a admis que la personne percutée était bien journaliste, voyons voir la vidéo du tweet : une personne lance un projectile sur une voiture de police, puis est coursée par la police, qui l'interpelle. Je ne vois pas vraiment de problème là-dedans, la procédure me semble normale, son acte ne l'est pas, tout a l'air bon pour moi.\nParlons du reste : factuellement, le journaliste dont on parlait un peu plus haut, a bien été percuté par un véhicule de police. On le voit clairement. Le tweet ici posté redirige vers une vidéo Youtube. J'ai cherché le moment d'où était issu l'extrait, et on peut le trouver à 12:48. On voit le journaliste apparaître à partir de 13:09, tout à gauche de l'écran, avec son casque blanc. Il a aussi une petite sacoche qui permet de bien le distinguer.\nLa police le bouscule, puisqu'elle cherche à interpeller l'homme à côté. Le journaliste s'éloigne donc un petit peu, pour les laisser travailler, et on le voit très clairement à 13:23 en train de filmer la scène, sans déranger la police. Aucun policier ne passant à côté de lui n'y voit quoique ce soit à redire par ailleurs.\nA 13:25, il se retourne, puis on voit à 13:33 qu'un policier se dirige vers lui, le pousse à la seconde d'après, et lui dit \"Tu fais quoi là [inintelligible]\" en levant le bras. Le journaliste recule donc, face à un policier qui se dirige vers lui, pour s'éloigner. A 13:38, on entend \"Attention derrière ! Attention derrière là !\", puis à 13:39 , le journaliste commence à se retourner, et on voit le véhicule de police rentrer dans le champ de la caméra. Entre le moment où le véhicule et le journaliste entrent en contact et le moment où le journaliste n'est plus en contact avec le véhicule suite au choc, on distingue très clairement que le véhicule n'est plus au même niveau par rapport au sol.\nRappel que le syndicat policier Synergie parle de \"pichenette involontaire d'un véhicule de police\". Eux-mêmes affirment que le véhicule a percuté le piéton.\nLa déduction est simple : le véhicule était en mouvement, et a percuté le journaliste qui se trouvait sur son chemin. \nD'après le site de la Sécurité Routière du Gouvernement :\n>Le piéton est l’usager le plus protégé par le code de la route : il a, quoiqu’il arrive, toujours la priorité sur la chaussée.\nEn revanche, les piétons ont également des devoirs : \n> Si des trottoirs sont aménagés et praticables, ils doivent les emprunter. \nLa question que je me pose est : est-ce que la rue où s'est déroulée la situation est une rue piétonne ou une chaussée (qui est destinée aux véhicules). On distingue plusieurs enseignes, dont le Rabelais, on sait que c'est à Nantes, une recherche rapide et grâce à Google Street, on arrive ici.\nBeaucoup de terrasses, peu de place pour la circulation de véhicules, pas de trottoir. Ma déduction est assez rapide : c'est sûrement une rue piétonne. Vérifions ça. On sait qu'il s'agit de la Rue du Bouffay, on sait que c'est à Nantes, je tape \"rue du bouffay rue piétonne nantes\" sur Google, et parmi les premiers liens, je trouve ce guide à destination des professionnels, avec pour objet \"Accéder, circuler et stationner facilement en centre-ville\".\nPremier paragraphe du guide : \n>Le centre-ville de Nantes s’est transformé : extension des aires piétonnes, création d’une zone à trafic limité cours des Cinquante-Otages, réaménagement des chaussées et des trottoirs. La priorité est donnée aux piétons, aux cyclistes et aux transports en commun… \nMême si on peut sûrement placer beaucoup de personnes dans un véhicule de police, je doute que celui-ci fasse partie des transports en commun.\nN'étant pas de mauvaise foi, je précise qu'il y a aussi ce paragraphe-ci, qui inclut probablement les véhicules de police :\n>L’hypercentre de Nantes est constitué d’aires piétonnes interdites à la circulation motorisée (sauf autorisations spécifiques, à l’allure du pas) et d’une zone à trafic limité (zone 30 d’accès réglementé).\nOn est donc dans une zone piétonne, certes autorisée aux véhicules de police. Le véhicule avait l'air de rouler au pas (fort heureusement), mais on peut donc affirmer que le piéton n'était pas en tort, bien au contraire.\nOn a dès lors trois éléments différents :\n\n\nUn individu a lancé un projectile sur un véhicule de police et a été interpellé, semble-t-il, dans les règles de l'art\n\n\nUn journaliste qui filmait l'interpellation mais qui n'avait aucun lien avec l'individu précédent, qui a reculé suite à une \"demande\" (avec de gros guillemets) d'un policier, et qui a été percuté par un véhicule, alors qu'il avait lui-même tous les droits de circulation, et n'est donc clairement pas en tort\n\n\nUn véhicule de police, conduit, supposément, par un policier, qui a percuté un piéton prioritaire (le fait qu'il soit journaliste n'a en fait AUCUN rapport avec le choc) dans une zone piétonne, et on sait que ce même véhicule a continué à avancer après le choc. \n\n\nD'après l'article R412-6 du Code de la route :\n>I.-Tout véhicule en mouvement ou tout ensemble de véhicules en mouvement doit avoir un conducteur. Celui-ci doit, à tout moment, adopter un comportement prudent et respectueux envers les autres usagers des voies ouvertes à la circulation. Il doit notamment faire preuve d'une prudence accrue à l'égard des usagers les plus vulnérables.\nVéhicule en mouvement : check. Comportement prudent : admettons, il roulait au pas. Prudence accrue à l'égard des usagers les plus vulnérables (dont les piétons) : pas check, il a réussi à en percuter un, dans une rue piétonne où les piétons sont donc prédominants.\n>II.-Tout conducteur doit se tenir constamment en état et en position d'exécuter commodément et sans délai toutes les manoeuvres qui lui incombent\nExécuter commodément et sans délai les manœuvres qui lui incombent, d'après ce que j'ai appris lors de mes cours au permis (et j'ai tous mes points), ça inclut également le fait de freiner lorsqu'un piéton s'approche, AVANT de le percuter. Donc pas check.\n>III.-Le fait, pour tout conducteur, de contrevenir aux dispositions du II ci-dessus est puni de l'amende prévue pour les contraventions de la deuxième classe.\nPour tout conducteur. Dont la police, bien évidemment, puisque la police se doit d'être irréprochable, étant donné qu'ils sont garants de la loi. Encore plus lorsqu'ils sont en service, en tenue, au volant d'un véhicule de police. \nJe n'irais pas jusqu'à dire que le policier au volant du véhicule de police a percuté délibérément le piéton. En revanche, on peut sans peine affirmer que si l'acte n'était pas volontaire mais le fait d'une distraction quelconque, d'un manque d'attention, le policier qui conduisait n'a pas respecté le code de la route.\nMerci donc pour cet \"élément de contexte\", qui nous prouve qu'il n'y a aucun lien entre le fait qu'un individu lance un projectile, et un journaliste qui le filme, qui nous confirme que les piétons étaient bien prioritaires, et que, face à un piéton (qu'importe son métier), le policier au volant du véhicule de police a commis une infraction.\nEdit rapide : \nJe n'ai pas mentionné la suite de la vidéo. \"Bouge, bouge !\" et \"Vous nous cassez les couilles les journalistes\", ça montre bien l'état d'esprit des policiers sur place.\nJuste après, des policiers cagoulés (et sans RIO) attrapent violemment un homme puis le jettent brusquement au sol. Nul doute que c'est bien évidemment autorisé par la procédure, n'est-ce pas ?",

Je ne pense pas qu'on devrait garder cela tabou.\nDans le cas présenté ici, le caissier a été très déplacé dans son commentaire, et c'est correct de vouloir soulever cela. Sauf que dans son texte, elle tente d'expliquer qu'il y a une nature raciste dans son discours. Comme si parle d'alcoolisme et de crimes lié à cela chez les premières nations seraient, de facto, raciste.\nConsidérant que son père, un homme que je respecte beaucoup, a eu des problèmes d'alcool, je trouve ça spécial qu'elle se lance dans ce genre de discours."

Une étape laborieuse mais indispensable, selon Amar, escort de 28 ans : «Il faut continuer à lutter, car la pénalisation du client nous met en danger !\"\nPourquoi l'article répète en boucle qu'il y a un lien entre la pénalisation du client et l'augmentation du nombre de meurtre tout en ne l'expliquant pas ? C'est si évident que ça ?\nAprès quelque recherche je tombe sur ça.  Il n'est pas question de violence où quoi que ce soit, mais l'association a un certain passif avec cette législation.\n>Cette pénalisation accrue a réduit le nombre de clients, poussant les travailleuses du sexe à faire des compromis qu’elles ne faisaient pas auparavant : Rita, 23 ans, explique qu’au-delà d’avoir été obligée de baisser ses tarifs de moitié (de cinquante euros la passe à vingt ou vingt-cinq euros actuellement) elle a davantage de mal à imposer le port du préservatif – s’exposant à des risques d’infection – ou de refuser certains clients.\nBah oui surprise, la loi est conçue pour ne plus rendre attractif la prostitution. Et comme c'est un marché, il faut s'occuper de l'offre et de la demande. On peut regretter l'éventuel manque d'accompagnement et de reconversion des TDS de la part de l'Etat mais tant que l'on me prouve pas la causalité entre les morts et la pénalisation du client, je pars du principe que c'est de la récupération d'un fait tragique pour dramatiser sa propre cause. CMV",
      "reply": "La prostitution est là et ne cessera pas quelque soit la loi. C'est un fait. On peut pénaliser un côté ou les deux, les prostituées sont toujours là.\nAvec la pénalisation du client ou de la demande pour prendre un système de marché, il y a une distorsion entre l'offre et la demande. La demande aura plus de pouvoir que l'offre dans un premier temps. Le problème est que la demande même avec une pénalisation ne s'écroule pas et reste même constante et va induire une offre. C'est le jeu du marché.\nPour acquérir la demande, l'offre va devoir s'effacer de la place public du moins en partie et baisser les prix. C'est là que la demande acquiert un pouvoir. Ce context devient favorable à tout type de trafics et de réseaux. C'est là un deuxième effet pervers. Des réseaux profitent d'introduire une concurrence déloyale car n'ayant pas les mêmes règles. Les prostituées des réseaux sont soumises et font ce que les proxénètes leurs demandent.\nDans ce cadre l'offre primaire devra descendre ses standards pour rester concurrentielle. C'est là que la demande a également du pouvoir.\nLa prohibition aux États-Unis est un autre exemple qu'une interdiction introduit de la violence car des réseaux vont en profiter pour donner une concurrence et une offre."

La taxe est aussi une bonne idée à mon avis.\nAprès, ça part dans le champ solide:\n> L’aspirant chef péquiste propose d’exiger des fournisseurs internet faisant affaire au Québec qu’ils bloquent la pornographie, à moins que le consommateur en fasse la demande.\n> « C’est sûr que la technologie le permet. [Et ça ne serait] pas différent de la façon dont les câblodistributeurs fonctionnent. On ne fait pas jouer d’entrée de jeu de la porno sur tous les postes. Il faut la solliciter. La même chose devrait s’appliquer [avec l’internet] », dit-il.\nEst-ce que quelqu'un peut expliquer à PSPP la neutralité du net? C'est un gros non ça.\n> Avec la croissance fulgurante de la pornographie dans la vie de bien des gens, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon se questionne aussi sur ce qui différencie la « bonne » pornographie (mettant en scène des relations sexuelles consensuelles et respectueuses) de celle qui valorise la domination. Il propose notamment de créer un comité d’experts pour interdire la production au Québec de films X qui comporterait des violences.\nJe trouve ça un peu débile aussi. Un comité de censure pour la porno? Yikes.\nEt, finalement, absolument rien pour protéger les travailleurs dans cette industrie-là, qui sont les plus vulnérables aux abus.",

Plus de détails ici\n>All told, the measures to contain coronavirus have resulted in reductions of 15% to 40% in output across key industrial sectors. This is likely to have wiped out a quarter or more of the country’s CO2 emissions over the past two weeks, the period when activity would normally have resumed after the Chinese new-year holiday. (See methodology below.) Over the same period in 2019, China released around 400m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), meaning the virus could have cut global emissions by 100MtCO2 to date. The key question is whether the impacts are sustained, or if they will be offset – or even reversed – by the government response to the crisis.\nFaut pas se mentir, entre son effet sur la baisse globale des activités, de la production, de la consommation, de la mort des vieux et de la survie des plus jeunes, le coronavirus est ce qui est arrivé de mieux à l'humanité du point de vue du climat. Une autre cause avec un effet semblable serait une guerre mondiale. Vous préférez quoi ?\nC'est évident que nous n'allons pas changer nos modes de vie à part contraint et forcé. Ou si des gens le font ce sera une ultra minorité sans effet notable. C'est tous les ans qu'il faut un nouveau coronavirus, et si j'avais 11 ans j'irais faire la bise aux vieux dans le parc.

La situation des anglophones en situation minoritaire, notamment en région, n'est pas la même que pour les ceuzes du West-Island. Je trouve ça important de ne pas essentialiser les anglophones comme des gens qui méprisent le Québec et les francophones. Je pourrais nommer des tonnes d'anglo-quebecois qui revendiquent un sentiment d'attachement profond envers notre pays et qui le disent haut et fort. Des artistes qui puisent dans la dualité linguistique comme moteur de création, des journalistes culturels qui font découvrir notre culture aux Canadians, des gens qui sont francophiles et qui font le choix de vivre en français dans l'espace public, même s'ils ont un gros accent pis qu'ils ont de la misère des fois, des gens qui envoient leurs enfants à l'école française malgré les hauts cris de leur communauté, juste parce qu'ils veulent rester ici et que leur enfant reste ici. \nL'école secondaire anglophone de Rouyn-Noranda est à veille de fermer par manque d'effectif (la communauté est à quoi, 3 ou 4%?). Dans les années 1970, la ville était moitié anglophone (Noranda), moitié francophone (Rouyn). Cela signifie que des gens dont leur langue maternelle est autre que celle de l'espace public ne peuvent guère se parler qu'au sein de leur communauté, qui décline d'année en année parce que les jeunes s'assimilent au français ou migrent dans d'autres provinces. On peut s'en réjouir, mais on devrait surtout s'en désoler, par pur empathie. Parce qu'on sait comment ça feel à Montréal de devoir revendiquer pour sa langue, parce qu'on sait comment les Franco-Ontariens ne l'ont pas facile.",
      "reply": "L’exemple de Rouyn-Noranda est un parmi tant d’autres.  Une fois hors de Montréal, les communautés anglophones au Québec en arrachent et meurent à petit feu.  Mais on n’en parle pas, parce qu’on ne fait que regarder Montréal, s’inquiéter de Montréal, et légiférer en fonction de Montréal.  Le résultat est que plein de petites communautés historiques du Québec - qui n’ont strictement rien à voir avec la situation à Montréal - disparaissent tranquillement dans le désintérêt total (voir même les applaudissements de certains) sous des politiques conçues pour Montréal mais d’application générale parce que c’est politiquement inconvénient d’admettre que Montréal est un cas linguistique particulier.\nTant qu’on s’indigne - avec raison - du traitement des communautés linguistiques francophones hors du Québec, tant ça me chagrine l’aveuglement volontaire qu’on fait chez nous du sort de nos propres communautés minoritaires écrasées derrière les statistiques nationales où le poids démographique de Montréal efface systématiquement la réalité bien différente de ces petites communautés."

Zeigt auch wieder, warum diese Menschen bei einem rechtsextremen Anschlag sofort wilde Verschwörungstheorien verbreiten: Es geht gar nicht so sehr darum, diese Theorien glaubhaft rüber zu bringen, weil die Verbreiter selbst genau wissen, dass diese unwahr sind. Es geht nur darum, sich selbst vor jeglicher Schuld rein zu waschen und gleichzeitig die Verrachtung für die Opfer zum Ausdruck zu bringen, denn, mal ganz ehrlich, diese Leute freuen sich insgeheim, dass hier Menschen umgebracht wurden, die sie für Fremd oder Minderwertig empfinden. Unmittelbar nach der Tat ist es einfach noch nicht angebracht, diese Thesen zu verbreiten, da die Menschen noch Mitgefühl für die Opfer haben. Wenn aber jemand diese Verschwörungen hört und glaubt, dann ist das Mitgefühl für die Opfer ganz schnell weg und der Hass richtet sich gegen diejenigen, die nichts mit der Tat zu tun haben oder sogar gegen den Täter gehandelt haben."

Nicht FPÖ-Wähler reiten gerne darauf rum, weil sie sich dadurch in ihrer \"FPÖ = insgeheim NSDAP\"-Ansicht bestätigt fühlen.\nWie wärs, wenn man die FPÖ effektiver angreift & zwar so, dass man dadurch auch FPÖ-Wähler selbst umstimmen kann & nicht nur in Selbstbestätigung badet?\nDass sich die FPÖ nicht gerade durch Kompetenz auszeichnet, was auf einigen Ebenen offensichtlich ist, bietet zB mMn eine viel bessere Angriffsfläche.",

Eine Theorie für die vielen rechten Gewalttaten in Deutschland ist, dass es jahrzehntelang keine Rechtsaußen-Partei gab, von der sich die Nazis vertreten fühlten (anders als bei uns).

Dann steckt der Dönermann vielleicht irgendeinen Kunden an, beim EDEKA irgendeinen anderen Kunden S-Bahn das gleiche (weil sich ja niemand zu 100% an die 'Regeln' hält, also Hände weg vom Gesicht usw).\nSuper, die Kontaktpersonen sind ermittelt. Das sind dann seine Mitarbeiter und Familienangehörige und vll der Dönermann noch. Juhu.

      "post": "Die FPÖ ist mit Abstand die \"rechteste\" Partei in Österreich. Warum sollten die ganzen Einzelfälle aus einer anderen Partei kommen? Ein Nazi wird sich ja wohl kaum in einer anderen Partei ansiedeln. Das regelmäßige Hinweisen, dass die Einzelfälle aus der FPÖ kommen wirkt auf mich wie ein klassisches vertauschen von Korrelation & Kausalität.\nKausalität: Nazis fühlen sich bei der FPÖ wohl, weil sie insgeheim eine Nazi-Partei ist. ❌\nKorrelation: Desto rechter eine Partei ist, desto eher wird ein Nazi sich dort wohl fühlen. ✅\nFalls es zB die FPÖ morgen nicht mehr geben würde, dann werden sich nach aktueller politischer Lage ja wohl kaum die ganzen Kellernazis zu den Grünen begeben, sondern zu der nächst-rechtesten Partei (was mMn aktuell die ÖVP wäre).\nIch glaube, dass FPÖ-Wähler sich nicht wirklich von dem stetigen Erwähnen & Anprangern der ganzen Einzelfälle beeindrucken lassen. Nicht FPÖ-Wähler reiten gerne darauf rum, weil sie sich dadurch in ihrer \"FPÖ = insgeheim NSDAP\"-Ansicht bestätigt fühlen.\nWie wärs, wenn man die FPÖ effektiver angreift & zwar so, dass man dadurch auch FPÖ-Wähler selbst umstimmen kann & nicht nur in Selbstbestätigung badet?\nDass sich die FPÖ nicht gerade durch Kompetenz auszeichnet, was auf einigen Ebenen offensichtlich ist, bietet zB mMn eine viel bessere Angriffsfläche.",
      "reply": "Die FPÖ macht schon auch Politik für Nazis durch Nazis. Das Problem ist, dass sie halt auch viele andere Themen abdecken (die sich sogar gegenseitig widersprechen können) und damit nicht nur so Gedankengut verbreiten. Früher haben sie von Mitte rechts (also alles ab der ÖVP) das größte Spektrum abgedeckt, was ihnen jetzt die ÖVP streitig macht und weswegen da Basti massiv gewinnt. Problem ist bei diesem Populismus, dass man ungefähr die selbe Integrität wie ein Kartenhaus im Wind hat."

Erstens bin ich noch immer angfressen und auch ein bisserl schockiert, für wieviele Menschen es anscheinend zu unbequem oder anstrengend ist, sich die Armbeuge vor die Pappn zu halten, wenn sie Niesen oder Husten; geschweige denn sich einfach nach dem Schnäuzen oder Toilettengang die Hände ausreichend zu waschen bzw. zu desinfizieren.\nIch frag mich wirklich wozu du das schreibst. Das in die Ellenbeuge niesen ist trotzdem kein Allheilmittel. Zumindest nicht für Corona. Jahrelang haben die Österreicher egal wo sie hinniesen dennoch sämtliche Influenza, Noro, Rhino und andere Coronaviren verbreitet.\n>(weil anscheinend z'deppat, die Armbeuge zu benützen - haben wir bis jetzt eh' nur 10 mal täglich im Radio und Fernsehen gehört, wie man es machen soll)\nIch hab das noch NIE im öffentlichen Kontext gehört. Ok, ich konsumiere kaum Fernsehen und kein Radio. Aber sowas hab ich noch nicht gehört.\nWas ich allerdings gehört habe ist, dass man es sogar den Kindergartenkindern beibringt. Inklusive oftmaliges Händewaschen. Wo dann diese Institutionen versagen ist, am Bereitstellen von Materialien die dafür geeignet sind. Unser Kindergartenkind kommt mit aufgerauten Händen nach Hause, weil die Seife die im Kindergarten verwendet wird von der übelsten billigsten Qualität ist, die man sich vorstellen kann. Bravo, Bravo Österreich!\n&#x200B;\nIch frag mich warum du dich gerade jetzt so aufregst. Ja, in Asien zucken sie alle zusammen, wenn du dich in der Öffentlichkeit schneuzt. Sowas hat es aber in Österreich noch nie gegeben und wird es auch die nächsten 30 Jahre nicht geben. Dafür sind wir nicht genug geprägt. Und ich meine das im tatsächlichen Sinne des Wortes. Der durchschnittliche Österreicher ist zu ignorant und blöd um zu \"glauben\", dass diese Maßnahmen was helfen. Ich hab schon vor 3 Wochen hier gesagt, ich bin so gespannt wie der Österreicher darauf reagieren wird, wenn es einmal zu uns kommen wird. Der Österreicher lässt sich einfach nix vorschreiben. Das ganze wird noch bunter und noch kurioser werden.\nNicht mal meine Verwandten lassen sich gegen die Influenza impfen obwohl ich mehrmals darauf hingewiesen hab, dass die Oma mit Chemo davon echt profitieren könnte. Blödheit ist leider nicht heilbar.",

Wieso es logisch sein sollte, dass der Geschäftszweig Cannabis den Trafikanten zufallen sollte ist mir nicht klar. Tabak und Cannabis - insbesondere CBD-Cannabis - sind zwei paar Schuhe genauso wie Tabak und Alkohol zwei paar Schuhe. CBD-Cannabis wird neben dem Rauchen als z.b. Backzutat, Öl, Tee und Medikament verwendet, wieso der Rauchaspekt - welcher als solcher auch zumeist nicht beworben wird - in irgendeiner Form ausschlaggebend sein sollte, wo man das kaufen kann, versteh ich ned.",

Dass dieser Fall passiert ist, ist bestürzend. Und wie er passiert ist, genau so. Aber das ist nicht der Normalfall dort. Auch wenn du wahrscheinlich grundsätzlich etwas gegen das Bundseheer hast, kann keiner ernsthaft damit rechnen, dass eine konkrete Person durch den Grundwehrdienst stirbt.

Anschober hat die Oberhand, und er kann frei agieren.\nEs gibt wirklich viel an Kurz zu kritisieren, aber man sollte sich immer auch die Frage stellen, ob man etwas auch kritisieren würde, wenn da wer anderer stehen würde.

      "reply": "Schwechat wird nie zur Drehscheibe werden, sondern ist und bleibt auch mit Bau der dritten Piste ein Punkt-zu-Punkt Flughafen. Mit dem Bau wird durch die spezifische Konstellation der Pisten nur 0,4 Mehr an Pistenkapazität erreicht, was unverhältnismäßig zu den Kosten ist. Die vorhandenen Pisten sind nicht ausgelastet und werden durch künstliche Nachfrageerzeugung der Billigairlines hochgehalten. Der Preiskampf von Billigairlines wird durch den Bau und das Incentiveprogramm des Flughafens verstärkt, die Mitarbeiter_innen der angesiedelten Airlines sind meist im Ausland angestellt und als Gastarbeiter_innen deklariert, eine arbeitnehmerrechtliche Farce, unter der vor allem Austrian Airlines leidet. Steuerliche Subvention auf Kerosin abschaffen und gleichzeitig dritte Piste bauen wollen ist ein betriebswirtschaftlich-politischer Widerspruch, der seine Auflösung darin findet, dass man das mit der Subventionsabschaffung auf Kerosin schlicht nicht ernst meint. Selbst bei Nichtabschaffung der Subventionen ist unklar, wer diese dritte Piste brauchen und verwenden soll - oder genauer: Der Bauträger freut sich, die VP freut sich, der Flughafenvorstand freut sich, die Arbeitslosigkeit wird während des Baus wsl. zurückgehen und es werden voraussichtlich auch langfristig mehr Jobs geschaffen. Nur kann man dieselben positiven Wirkungen auch durch den Ausbau von Öffis erreichen, und man fördert dabei nicht Sozial- und Lohndumping und Klimaverschmutzung. \nEs gibt eine Rechtsanwältin, Dr. Susanne Heger, die einen offenen Brief an LH Mikl-Leitner geschrieben hat. Darin findest du die gesamte Argumentation sehr übersichtlich und dann detaillierter ausgearbeitet. Der Clue daran ist, dass der Bau natürlich auf Klima-Ebene abzulehnen ist, aber eben auch betriebswirtschaftlich sehr viele Fragen aufwirft, die von den Befürworter_innen, allen voran Mikl-Leitner, nicht beantwortet werden. Stattdessen hört man dann was von \"Drehscheibe\" und \"Bratislava\". Ich kanns mir nicht verkneifen: Politiker_innen ungeprüft beim Wort nehmen ist keine gute Herangehensweise und insbesondere VP-Politiker_innen ungeprüft beim Wort nehmen eigentlich ein Tod der Vernunft.

Toch wil ik benadrukken dat huidskleur 9 van die 10 keer wel een rol speelt aangezien ik zeker niet altijd zo gekleed ben.

Echter heb ik inmiddels geen baan meer en kan ik het gewoon niet betalen (gaat om wat honderden euros voor 1 jaar aan dansles). Is wat ik heb getekend genoeg voor hen om me lastig te blijven vallen? Of zou ik er onderuit kunnen komen omdat er niet daadwerkelijk een bedrag op het contract staat? Ik weet dat het niet echt netjes is van me, maar ik kan het gewoon echt niet betalen, ik moet eerst maar eens kijken of ik niet dakloos ben over 2 maanden. Iemand met juridische achtergrond misschien die weet of ik hier problemen aan overhoud of niet?",

Wat als je geluk hebt, corona krijgt en geen symptomen hebt, dus je isoleert jezelf niet want je weet niet dat je het hebt. Op straat loop je langs iemand die kanker heeft en op het moment chemotherapie krijgt en je infecteert deze persoon. Dit soort mensen kunnen geen vaccinatie krijgen vanwege een beschadig immuunsysteem door chemo. Doordat jij je niet laat vaccineren heb je iemand een doodsbrief gegeven. De persoon met chemotherapie die over kanker heen had kunnen komen is nu overleden. Dit is waarom iedereen die zich kan laten vaccineren zich zou moeten vaccineren. Om er super zeker van te zijn dat de vaccinatie graad hoog genoeg is voor de medemens die zich niet kan laten vaccineren.\nVerder ben je zo te horen vooral aan het redeneren op basis van aannames. Ik heb het idee dat je vooral op zoek bent naar bevestiging van je aannames zonder feitelijke fundering. Misschien moet je maar eens goed naar jezelf kijken. En vooral, bang of niet, ben alsjeblieft niet asociaal.",

Als ik alles zou weten zou ik toch niet twijfelen over überhaupt iets in deze wereld. Maar je kan nooit alles weten, dus doe je door redenering en onderzoek aannames. Maar je kan niet voor al je keuzes alles onderzoeken.\nDe eerste alinea kan ik in komen maar de tweede vind ik zelf een beetje asociaal waar je zelf allerlei ongefundeerde aannames doet."

Als je zegt dat de illuminati allemaal lizards zijn, zou dit op feitelijkheid gecorrigeerd mogen worden, anders is het satire en moet een dergelijk programma als satire bestempeld worden door factuele onjuistheid.

Niet wettelijk verplicht, jij mag je geld terug eisen. \nHet probleem begint, als het bedrijf hierin koppig is en het alsnog niet gaat doen, dan kan de politie hier niet veel mee. Maar dan moet het via een procedure en die winkels gokken erop dat jij daar geen zin en geld voor over hebt. Als het om echt veel geld gaat, kan je altijd nog proberen om een serieuze nette aangetekende brief te schrijven met een klein dreigementje met zaken als een procedure, Trosradar of iets soortgelijks.\nPersoonlijk kom ik, bij die winkels die met tegoedbonnen werken of producten simpelweg niet meer terugnemen, bij die winkels nooit weer en laat ik een negatieve review achter bij Google.\nSucces!",

Het is net zo lastig als Mandarijn, de Chinese taal, niet het fruit. Er zijn meer uitzonderingen dan gramaticale- en spellings-regels.\nAls Nederlanders horen dat je hun taal niet vloeiend spreekt, spreken ze al snel Engels tegen je, waardoor het heel lastig is om ervaring op te doen in het spreken van Nederlands.

Mensen die denken dat ze informatie hebben die deze experts niet hebben... Jij komt niet zo over, omdat je wel gelooft in het belang van vaccinatie.\nEchter je zegt dat je denkt dat ondanks dat het belangrijk is dat vaccinaties plaatsvinden dat jij je niet zou hoeven te vaccineren. Ik vind het persoonlijk hypocriet. Dat is hetzelfde als zeggen als genoeg andere mensen belasting betalen, dan hoef ik het niet te doen, want er is niet genoeg schade aan de gemeenschap om detrimental te zijn. Wat maakt jou zo bijzonder dat andere mensen in de samenleving wel moeten investeren in het belang van de gemeenschap en jij niet?",

Echter binnen groepen en ook binnen de wetenschappelijke wereld zijn er genoeg voorbeelden dat er een consensus is en je daar niet te veel van dient af te wijken, wil je gerespecteerd blijven door je peers. Dit gaat vrijdenken tegen.\nDaarmee wil ik niet zeggen dat dit nu het geval is \nOp je tweede punt ingaand. Daar ben ik het grotendeels met je eens. Iedereen die het kan moet proportioneel belasting betalen. Een goede vergelijking. Normaal loop ik graag vooraan om een kar te trekken maar ik zit momenteel niet in een geweldige levensfase. Dat kan ook meespelen in mijn egoïstisch denkwijze."

Verder kiezen de meeste mensen voor een bepaald partij-programma (het beleid wat ze beloven te gaan uitvoeren), niet voor diegene die toevallig lijsttrekker is. \nOmdat het eigenlijk nooit voorkomt dat een partij meer dan de helft van de zetels behaald, zal er altijd een coalitie worden gevormd, hier zullen meerdere partijen (die samen meer dan de helft van de stemmen hebben) hun partij-programma's naast elkaar leggen, en een gezamenlijk regerings-plan vormen. Misschien dat je dit als ondemocratisch beschouwd, maar dit is een stuk democratischer (=eerlijker) dan wanneer je 1 partij de boel laat bepalen.\n> ik denk dat ik voor de gemiddelde medelander kan spreken als ik zeg dat ik het gevoel heb dat ik niet weet wat vrijheid is.\nIk ben het hier niet mee eens. Ik voel me vrij, en ik kan me geen manier inbeelden waarop dat niet zo is. Kan je een voorbeeld geven van wanneer jij je niet vrij voeldde?\n> mensen die hun leven hebben opgeofferd voor onze vrijheden zouden dat met de kennis van nu geen tweede keer doen.\nSoldaten in de 2de wereldoorlog, bedoel je? Ik denk dat wanneer je daadwerkelijk ten tijde van de 2de wereldoorlog hebt geleefd, je hier wel anders over zou denken. Hoe vervelend je de overheid ook vindt, ze voeren geen razzia's uit, ze sluiten geen mensen op zonder proces, ze behandelen iedereen gelijk. Ook hebben we nog persvrijheid, dus als het blijkt dat de overheid wel iets doet wat niet door de beugel kan, dan hoor je dat gelijk.\n> een systeem waarin daklozen worden gebruikt als herinnering aan het feit dat het altijd nog slechter kan is betreurenswaardig\nJe bedoelt dit vast niet letterlijk, maar het is natuurlijk niet zo dat het Nederlandse systeem mensen dakloos maakt (en al helemaal niet om een 'voorbeeld' te maken voor anderen). Natuurlijk kan beleid wel invloed hebben op het aantal daklozen, en dit is zeker in de hand gewerkt door jarenlang rechts-liberaal beleid (snijden in vangnetten), maar er is natuurlijk geen enkele rechts-liberaal die meer daklozen wil. Sterker nog, wanneer je het hun zelf zou vragen zouden ze waarschijnlijk claimen dat ze de hoeveelheid werklozen omlaag hebben gehaald doordat hun economisch beleid de economie heeft verbeterd. \n>een systeem dat budgettair afhankelijk is van de accijnzen die het ontvangt over dodelijke producten is betreurenswaardig.\nHeb je het dan over tabaks-accijnzen? De reden van de tabaks-accijnzen is om A: mensen te ontmoedigen van te roken (het is duurder, dus dan doe je het minder vaak (volgens economische theorieën)), en B: om de uiteindelijke gezondheidskosten van de rokers deels bij de rokers te leggen. Op die manier betalen rokers meer aan de gezondheidszorg (want ze zullen er waarschijnlijk ook meer gebruik van maken) dus is het eerlijker. Dit is hetzelfde principe als bijvoorbeeld de wegenbelasting (alleen mensen met een auto betalen dit).\n> een systeem die verkrachters 14 dagen de tijd geeft om slachtoffers af te laten zien van aangifte is betreurenswaardig.\nIk weet niet wat je bedoelt met deze zin; misschien bedoel je dat er een minimale termijn is voordat je aangifte mag doen van een zedendelict? Ik weet niet of dat zo is, maar dat mag van mij ook wel afgeschaft worden als dat zo is. \n> door mee te helpen met het verzekeren van de overzeese belangen van de amerikanen staat ons volk onder terreurdreiging. \nDit ben ik (deels) met je eens. \n>  het toestaan van het stationeren van nucleaire wapens op Nederlands grondgebied maakt ons tot vijand van hun vijanden. \nHet heeft ons wel beschermd tegen de USSR. de USSR (en Rusland nu) is nooit bepaald vies geweest van het inpikken van landen aan hun grens. Het ijzeren gordijn was akelig dichtbij na de 2de wereldoorlog, als Amerika Europa niet zou helpen verdedigen dan zouden dat hele enge tijden zijn geweest. Net zoals ze nu Ukraïne bezetten (voordat ze tot Europa zouden toetreden)\n> er staat een europese invasie op de agenda tijdens oud en nieuw en een boycot van de amerikanen is de enige oplossing.\nHoe bedoel je? \n> een boycot van de amerikanen\nLol. Oke, laten we een van onze grootste export-partners boycotten! Daar hebben we vast alleen maar voordeel van /s",

Zelfs de hoogst aangeschreven medische tijdschriften staan vol met foute optelsommen, gemiddeldes die niet kloppen en foutmarges die lager zijn dan gezien de grootte van dataset mogelijk is.

Maar dit is niet hoe onderzoek gedaan wordt, omdat die journals vooral kwalitatieve documenten maken (pyschologie is moeilijk te kwantificeren), waarbij zoiets als viral onderzoek wel kwantitatief getest kan worden. \nIk zou je graag willen duiden op het feit dat jou voorbeeld een \"opinion\" piece is. Dit betekend dat het iemands mening is, en dus niet per ce volledig te vertrouwen is. \nWat ik wel terug vind in de artikel die jij doorgeeft, is de druk die op onderzoekers gezet wordt om te publiseeren, of om bij peer-reviews oneerlijk te zijn. Dit kan beide kanten op gaan, maar dit is zeker niet goed voor onderzoek en voor de resultaten die het brengt.\nDaarop wil ik wel zeggen dat vaak slechte papers over tijd weer retracted worden, als er eenmaal voldoende tegenbewijs is."

En tegelijk neig je een beetje naar vaccinatie, wat je ook redelijk lijkt te maken. Dus ik zou zeggen: kijk even wat je van de vrijwel unanieme boodschap van deze anonieme internetadviseurs vindt en bepaal voor jezelf of je je erin kunt vinden. Als je om een moreel kompas kwam vragen heb je je antwoord. Wat je ermee doet moet je zelf weten, want het blijft jouw keuze. Maar de morele keuze zou zijn: vaccineren.\nDoor Forum-stemmers ook wel denigrerend 'deugen' genoemd. Alsof normaal doen slecht is. \n(de wappie hierboven zou zomaar een Baudet-fan kunnen zijn)"

É feita de carne de porco.\nFoi a alheira e não a farinheira que foi utilizada pelos cristãos novos para iludir a Santa Inquisição; fingiam que comiam um enchido de carne de porco, enquanto na realidade a alheira não a tem; como já referi é feita de carne de aves ou de caça.\nEu gosto das duas, cada uma no seu “meio ambiente”.",

E como eu tenho um lado bastante confrotacional nao sei se tenho razao ou nao...\nAula de empreendorismo com dois cursos, o meu e outro onde conheco algumas pessoas (mas ninguem que estava na aula). Ora bem ha um cabrao na aula que tem uma empresa.\nFoda-se eu juro-vos. Ja nao me irritava tanto numa aula ha colhoes. É que o gajo nao se calava. Um segundo. Eu ja nem sabia se era ele ou o professor a dar a aula. Interrumpia o professor constantemente, acabava as frases. Depois a dada altura vira-se \"Eu agora vou ser polemico mas eu acho que ninguem pode aprender a ser emreendedor ou se nasce com isso ou nao\"'. MAS NINGUEM ESTA A FALAR DISSO MEU CARALHO.\nE depois meteu-se a falar da opiniao dele sobre se uma empresa podia ter sucesso ou nao. E eu ja nao sabia se era suposto estar a apontar alguma coisa ou nao porque afinal nao era o professor que estava a falar, era ele. E depois meteu-se a falar do facto da empresa ter nao sei quantas divisoes em nao sei quantos pontos do pais e que estava a ter sucesso e bla bla bla e tinham um folheto diversificado bla bla bla\nTres horas. Tres horas nesta merda. Tres colegas meus sairam. Outros estavam no nosso chat de curso a reclamar.\nA dada altura o gajo volta a interrumper a perguntar como funciona o investimento do IPAMEI e o professor volta a cortar o que estava a dizer para o ajudar e eu passei-me foda-se acho que é normal\n\"Oh professor mas isto tem alguma coisa a ver com a materia\"\nSilencio.\nToda a alma caladinha naquela sala\n\"Desculpe?\"\n\"Eu acho que ja houve interrupcoes suficientes ao programa para uma aula, nao?\"\n\"Mas a aula nao se chama Empreendorismo e Investimento?\"\n\"Chama? Eu penso que sim mas por esta altura ja nem sei\"\n\"Nao estou a perceber as suas objecoes. O seu colega esta com uma duvida em relacao a uma avaliacao realizada por uma entidade de investimentos, qual é o problema\"\nE eu por esta altura desisti porque sabia que continuar a discutir so ia dar mais merda e que ia perder a razao toda\n\"Esta bem professor deixe estar nao importa\"\n\"Estamos a falar de gastronomia por acaso?\"\nRisinhos do outro curso (o outro gajo é desse curso)\n\"Esta bem professor\"\n\"Nao estou a perceber o seu problema jovem\"\n\"Esta bem professor nao se preocupe\"\nSaí de la com uma neura do caralho fds. Ainda estou irritado",
      "reply": "Sinceramente não tiveste bem, a culpa foi do outro palhaço que se queria mostrar, o prof não teve culpa. Estavas irritado com o palhaço e descarregaste no prof que não tem culpa.\nAinda para mais se realmente a pergunta era sobre matéria da cadeira.\nSe tivesses falado antes e com mais educação se calhar até te safas, agora a altura e o tom da abordagem foram completamente errados.\n&#x200B;\nEDIT: E escreve-se interromper e não interrumper"

      "post": "Fazem 5 anos que estudo ML como hobby, mais especificamente deep learning que é a base pra todos esses modelos que vcs veem no hype  hoje por aí. E é impressionante como o estado de negação das pessoas em geral é constante, independente do avanço tecnológico na frente dos olhos de todos.\nQuem critica AI falando que não pensa, podem adicionar um “ainda” aí. Já li vários papers bem promissores sobre modelos que fazem chain-of-thought. Ou seja, já existem modelos capazes de efetuar uma forma rudimentar de linha de raciocínio.\nLembrem-se que tecnologias estão evoluindo de forma praticamente exponencial hoje em dia. Um exercício pra vcs entenderem o que está por vir no campo de inteligência artificial: há cerca de 15 anos o primeiro iPhone foi lançado. Observem a diferença dos celulares daquele época pros atuais que achamos comum hoje em dia. É isso que está vindo por aí. \nA hora que atingirmos o nível onde esses modelos consigam substituir humanos com relativa facilidade, nossa sociedade vai entrar numa convulsão que não consigo nem imaginar como será. E pra muita profissão atual nem precisa ser AGI ein.",

E, como você disse, a tecnologia está evoluindo muito rápido... E, ainda mais, temos uma batalha das grandes empresas de tecnologia para mostrar qual é o chatbot é o melhor. No final, isso vai acelerar ainda mais o progresso tecnológico da inteligência artificial.\nMano, eu estou meio que interessado em estudar Machine Learning. Na sua opinião, quais são os primeiros passos que eu devo nessa área de conhecimento? Não sei quase nada de programação (apesar de eu estar estudando aos poucos estudando JavaScript e HTML), mas eu vejo que é preciso entender isso ao ponto de a gente mesmo criar nosso robozinho pensador hehehe"

      "post": "Alarmismo ou não, tendo em conta a multiplicação de casos em todos os países Europeus, acho que daqui a um mês estaremos a contar os casos em PT aos milhares.\nMesma coisa na maior parte dos países Europeus que não tem o poder central autoritário da China que lhes permitiu ter a resposta agressiva que tiveram no que toca à contenção do vírus. \nO mais preocupante de facto é esta aparente passividade do governo que não tem feito NADA, absolutamente NADA, para antecipar a inevitabilidade da escalada de casos. Na minha opinião, o governo acabará por cair mais cedo ou mais tarde por causa desta situação.\nTivemos uns bons 10 dias de handicap positivo em relação a outros países. Um período sem casos que deveriam ter sido usados para preparar a infraestrutura e criar stocks de bens essenciais para os profissionais da saúde. Contudo, acham que alguma coisa foi feito acerca disso? Claro que não.\nUm governo responsável teria já tratado do seguinte:\n- Definido vários locais em cada concelho para isolamento de doentes (como na China em que usaram escolas e pavilhões industriais),\n- Começado a abastecer-se em massa de máscaras, fatos, luvas. Se não no mercado internacional, com empresas nacionais no imediato,\n- Verificado STOCKS de medicamentos antigripais usados no combate aos sintomas,\n- Aquisição, ou melhor, produção junto a empresas nacionais de máquinas de ventilação,\n- Preparado um certo tipo de requisição civil voluntária e devidamente paga junto de médicos reformados, estudantes da área da saúde, bombeiros e voluntários com certa qualificação, para assistir a um potencial e provável colapso no SNS,\n- Elaborar estratégias de lockdown de áreas específicas e garantir o abastecimento alimentar racionado às mesmas,\n- Aplicadas restrições a saídas e entradas do país para certas zonas mais afectadas, reduzindo as mesmas a 0 ou a casos específicos (Itália. Coreia do Sul e Irão deveriam estar banidos de momento),\n- Criado equipas de desinfecção de transportes públicos, áreas com grande pressão demográfica e recintos com forte afluência,\n- Cancelamento de todos os eventos com participação internacional em grande número, especialmente os que incluem países severamente afectados,\n- Etc.\nBem, isso seria o que um governo pro activo deveria fazer. Contudo, com a falta de recursos humanos e financeiros do estado e do SNS, o foco do governo tem sido centrado à volta do semblante de calma e falso controlo da situação. É mais importante salvaguardar a imagem do que realmente por as fichas todas no centro da mesa e preparar aquilo que, quanto a mim, será inevitável.\nSe vão existir + ou - nº de casos e uma % +or ou -or de fatalidades, é algo que não preocupa muito. O que preocupa é saber de antemão que os casos se vão multiplicar e que o nosso sistema, já de si miserável, irá sucumbir ao primeiro sinal de pressão.\nE quando isso acontecer, não haverá palavras que o governo possa atirar ao ar para acalmar as hostes pois, ao contrário de outras nações com sistemas mais funcionais, nós temos 0 fé nas capacidades destes últimos governos em lidar com cenários de crise.\nForam décadas a mais a pavonearem-se no poleiro mais preocupados em assegurar o tacho do que a fazer o trabalho deles que passa, em grande parte, pela protecção da população.",
      "reply": ">Mesma coisa na maior parte dos países Europeus que não tem o poder central autoritário da China que lhes permitiu ter a resposta agressiva que tiveram no que toca à contenção do vírus.\nE um tanto mais complexo que isso receio, e um jogo politico. Em democracia teriam mais a perder em eleicoes pelo impacto economico de declarar lei marcial e tomar accoes muito cedo que mesmo pelo eventual amontoar de corpos (morreu uma quantidade estupida de gente em Leiria e com incendios por exemplo, e nao houve problema nenhum).\nNa China o que aconteceu so foi possivel por ter sido encuberto, mesmo sendo o sistema de saude da china dos poucos realmente preparados em protocolo com sistemas de aviso avancados e automatizados este tipo de doencas como o SARS. Portanto muitos dedos se viraram para o CCP. O povo acredita plenamente que o CCP lhes trara riqueza independentemente da quarentena, mas com tanto boato a circular a subsistencia do CCP fica ameacada pelo virus.\nEstao a brincar com a saude das pessoas por mandatos de 4 anos."

Eu dúvido que eles sequer pegaram uma viatura e deram a volta no quarteirão, quem dirá tentar ir atrás e/ou localizar os bandidos que me roubaram.\nEram 3, um me segurou por trás com uma faca espetada em minhas costas enquanto me enforcava com o braço, já os outros dois me revistaram violentamente, eles enfiavam a mão nos meus bolsos e simplesmente puxava rasgando a minha roupa, eu estava indo pro trabalho e tive que voltar pra casa seja pelo susto que passei ou pelo meu uniforme que estava destruído, até mesmo meus sapatos eles arrancaram pra ver se eu tava escondendo algo nas meias, pegaram até mesmo no meu pau pra ver se tinha algum objeto na cueca.\nFoi o assalto mais agressivo que tive, só faltou os caras me deixar pelado e levar as roupas do meu corpo.",

Tava indo pra casa por volta de meia noite quando chegou um cara por trás enforcando e provavelmente colocando algo nas minhas costas - nem lembro - e outros dois que foram pegando as coisas. Aí depois ficaram ameaçando e tal e eu sai andando. Isso no centro de Petrópolis. Ainda levaram meu guarda-chuva e começou a chover logo depois... Fiz o BO online e fui chamado pra depor, o que me deixou bem surpreso, já que achei que não ia acontecer mais nada. Antes eu tentei ir na delegacia, mas os policiais estavam de greve, então só fariam algo se fosse assassinato ou coisa pior.\nQuando cheguei lá descobri que eles compravam o próprio uniforme de uma costureira em SP. Meio precário. \nNo meu segundo assalto não me dei ao trabalho de fazer BO. Deveria né, mas acabei deixando de lado."

      "post": "Alarmismo ou não, tendo em conta a multiplicação de casos em todos os países Europeus, acho que daqui a um mês estaremos a contar os casos em PT aos milhares.\nMesma coisa na maior parte dos países Europeus que não tem o poder central autoritário da China que lhes permitiu ter a resposta agressiva que tiveram no que toca à contenção do vírus. \nO mais preocupante de facto é esta aparente passividade do governo que não tem feito NADA, absolutamente NADA, para antecipar a inevitabilidade da escalada de casos. Na minha opinião, o governo acabará por cair mais cedo ou mais tarde por causa desta situação.\nTivemos uns bons 10 dias de handicap positivo em relação a outros países. Um período sem casos que deveriam ter sido usados para preparar a infraestrutura e criar stocks de bens essenciais para os profissionais da saúde. Contudo, acham que alguma coisa foi feito acerca disso? Claro que não.\nUm governo responsável teria já tratado do seguinte:\n- Definido vários locais em cada concelho para isolamento de doentes (como na China em que usaram escolas e pavilhões industriais),\n- Começado a abastecer-se em massa de máscaras, fatos, luvas. Se não no mercado internacional, com empresas nacionais no imediato,\n- Verificado STOCKS de medicamentos antigripais usados no combate aos sintomas,\n- Aquisição, ou melhor, produção junto a empresas nacionais de máquinas de ventilação,\n- Preparado um certo tipo de requisição civil voluntária e devidamente paga junto de médicos reformados, estudantes da área da saúde, bombeiros e voluntários com certa qualificação, para assistir a um potencial e provável colapso no SNS,\n- Elaborar estratégias de lockdown de áreas específicas e garantir o abastecimento alimentar racionado às mesmas,\n- Aplicadas restrições a saídas e entradas do país para certas zonas mais afectadas, reduzindo as mesmas a 0 ou a casos específicos (Itália. Coreia do Sul e Irão deveriam estar banidos de momento),\n- Criado equipas de desinfecção de transportes públicos, áreas com grande pressão demográfica e recintos com forte afluência,\n- Cancelamento de todos os eventos com participação internacional em grande número, especialmente os que incluem países severamente afectados,\n- Etc.\nBem, isso seria o que um governo pro activo deveria fazer. Contudo, com a falta de recursos humanos e financeiros do estado e do SNS, o foco do governo tem sido centrado à volta do semblante de calma e falso controlo da situação. É mais importante salvaguardar a imagem do que realmente por as fichas todas no centro da mesa e preparar aquilo que, quanto a mim, será inevitável.\nSe vão existir + ou - nº de casos e uma % +or ou -or de fatalidades, é algo que não preocupa muito. O que preocupa é saber de antemão que os casos se vão multiplicar e que o nosso sistema, já de si miserável, irá sucumbir ao primeiro sinal de pressão.\nE quando isso acontecer, não haverá palavras que o governo possa atirar ao ar para acalmar as hostes pois, ao contrário de outras nações com sistemas mais funcionais, nós temos 0 fé nas capacidades destes últimos governos em lidar com cenários de crise.\nForam décadas a mais a pavonearem-se no poleiro mais preocupados em assegurar o tacho do que a fazer o trabalho deles que passa, em grande parte, pela protecção da população.",

Não tenho as maiores crenças no SNS, mas 3300 a cada 5 semanas não me parece mau (tendo em conta que nem todas irão precisar de ventiladores/UCI). \nNão fiz pesquisa nenhuma de valores, apenas te mostrei um bocadinho de estatística e lógica que não aplicaste nos números que referiste.\nTemos de ter cuidado, mas o que ganhas em ser pessimista? Vais resolver os problemas do SNS assim? Se te informasses vias que testar não resolve uma vez que há transmissão assintomática do vírus. Itália foi dos primeiros a testar os voos da China. Se disseres: colocar quem chega da China ou Itália de quarentena 21 dias como os que foram repatriados, ok, é capaz de ajudar. Mas em breve é provável que outros países fiquem com um # de casos maior (espanha, frança, alemanha principalmente pelos dados recentes). Vais colocar toda a gente de quarentena e bloquear viagens? Não estou a querer dizer qual é a situação ideal, apenas a mostrar que não é algo fácil de definir e é preciso ajustar de acordo com os casos, número de casos, situação global /europeia, etc."

Usar luva é completamente desnecessário pois o vírus também é transportado por esse meio, e se meteres a mão no rosto (com ou sem luva) podes transportar o vírus na mesma.\nSe estás num transporte público a proximidade com outras pessoas é um risco muito maior. Sempre podes ter o cuidado de não levar a mão ao rosto e sempre lavar, mas se alguém ao teu lado (menos de 2 metros) estiver com o vírus e tossir/espirrar na tua direcção não há nada que possas fazer."

Eu poderia tomar algo tipo Soylent pra não ter que comer nada, mas líquidos densos não consigo tomar.\nSe eu fizer a lista das minhas seletividades vai ficar enorme. Mas uma coisa que posso citar é que não como nada branco, não consigo. Nada mesmo. E nenhum líquido que seja denso igual vitamina ou shake desses de whey.\nE com sou extremamente sensível com gosto (meu paladar é bem sensível) e já trabalhei com gastronomia, mesmo ficando com fome eu acabo ficando sem comer ao invés de pedir delivery porque acho tudo mal preparado e com gosto ruim.\nAcho que eventualmente meu corpo vai colapsar mas fazer o que, já tentei de tudo.",

Meu paladar também é complicado, mas vou levando do jeito que dá, o problema é a idade chegando e o corpo não aceitando mais qualquer tranqueira haha ..."

Porém é um pouco mais caro que dolce gusto e três corações. \nA Dolce gusto tem umas opções de chás, capuccinos etc que são interessantes.

A partir do momento em que decidem agir como qualquer outra pessoa, deixam de sentir que estão a marchar contra algum tipo de opressão. Fazer parte de um grupo marginalizado faz-te sentir especial, batalhador e vítima de opressão, o que, por seu lado, confere-te o direito de atribuires aos outros a culpa pelos teus males. É um grande peso que retiras das costas, quando podes simplesmente dizer que a vida te corre mal porque és uma vítima. Olhas para a forma como muitas lésbicas se vestem e concluis de imediato que querem pertencer a uma tribo. Não querem ser confundidas com uma mulher banal. Neste caso, o objectivo não é serem aceites e respeitadas, mas sim serem o foco da atenção da sociedade.\nJá agora, as pessoas muitas vezes criam subs não por necessidade mas porque querem ser donas de uma comunidade. Faz lembrar os tempos de IRC, em que tinhas os canais principais e depois canais totalmente desnecessários derivados desses canais principais que eram criados apenas para conferir a uns poucos o controlo que não têm no canal principal. Tinhas o #WWE, mas depois alguém criava o #RAW e o \"Smackdown. Tinhas o #Sexo, mas depois alguém criava o #Foda. Tinhas o #putas, depois alguém criava o #vadias. Tinhas o #Gay, mas depois alguém criava o #LGBT."

É muito fácil apontar onde é que estiveste mal, mas na altura é muito fácil cometer erros desses, principalmente se a pessoa com quem foste fazer negócio agir de má-fé. \nNão te vou dizer o que fazer nessa situação. Tu é que sabes as tuas circunstâncias e ninguém na net sabe melhor da tua vida que tu.\nO teu problema é que uma pessoa tem um carro que está em teu nome e que pode ser utilizado para fins ilícitos. Comunica isso à polícia. Se houver merda queres ter um registo em como foste à policia. Depois considera o negócio feito. Manda uma mensagem à pessoa a pedir a assinatura e que se não assinar vais dar o carro como roubado. Quanto à questão da espera, tu é que sabes. Podes referir isso à policia, é crime de ameaça. Podes dizer à pessoa que vais dizer à policia. Podes dizer que não vais cair em esquemas, que viu o carro e decidiu comprá-lo, fizeste o negócio de boa-fé e que daí para a frente é problema do comprador. Mas mais  uma vez, tu é que sabes as tuas circunstâncias.",

Bem, vou para o metro, nao me sento e se der para estar a um canto levantada a pelo menos 1 metro de outra pessoa, muito bem. Se apanhar carruagens muito cheias e for sardinha enlatada rezo so para ninguém burro tossir/espirrar para o ar e normalmente so fico em carruagens assim durante 1 minuto ou assim, mas é o suficiente para haver muito momento de reza. Chego à faculdade, lavo as mãos. Chego a casa depois de sair do metro, lavo as maos. Vou lavando as maos quando uso espaços comuns (cozinha, wc), porque não vivo sozinha e as pessoas que vivem comigo não têm o mesmo cuidado que eu. Desinfeto o telemóvel de cada vez que entro em casa, depois de ter andado na rua. E o máximo que posso fazer é isto...Não depende so de ti, infelizmente esgotamos álcool no supermercado mas as pessoas continuam sem noção de higiene."

Seria antes estúpido da parte do governo não aproveitar esta oportunidade de negócio.",
      "reply": "Embora seja a favor da legalização, acho que antes de defender algo é preciso estar ciente dos aspetos negativos e não defender só porque a moca é boa.\n\nEstá provado que a Cannabis promove depressão e esquizofrenia em indivíduos em que estas doenças existem mas não são manifestadas ou evidentes.\nEstá provado que causa dependência se consumida em grandes quantidades ou constantemente.\nEstá provado que fumo proveniente de Cannabis queimada contribui para o cancro do pulmão.\nEstá provado que se a Cannabis não levar um flush antes de colhida que o fumo faz ainda mais mal porque não foram removidos os nutrientes.\n\nPosto este aspeto de lado, acredito que a Cannabis em Portugal só vai ser legalizada para fins medicinais onde as pessoas terão de alimentar uma industria farmacêutica que produz medicamentos com uma percentagem mínima de CBD de plantas modificadas para o propósito. Houve um evento há uns anos com médicos e defensores da legalização que diziam contentar-se com a legalização da Cannabis para fins medicinais, em que produtores teriam de ter condições (não especificadas) e licenciamento do estado, pelo menos foi a ideia com que fiquei. Já havia em Portugal produção de Cannabis de uma empresa farmacêutica dos UK e já começa a haver outras empresas a investir no negócio em Portugal, infelizmente para o Estado ou os representantes só interessa se for assim."

O que o PSD rejeitou foi que fosse o Governo a decidir quem podia ou não podia competir no mercado da venda. (Só para clarificar: O PSD era a favor das empresas poderem entrar neste mercado e produzirem/venderem a droga que quiserem dentro de limites legais, não me referia a privados cultivarem. O BE pretendia o auto-cultivo como sendo uma possibilidade, mas apenas se adquirisses as sementes às lojas escolhidas a dedo pelo Estado. Um é a favor do mercado livre e o BE a favor de criar um monopólio controlado por eles)\n\nE, como não seria de estranhar, os grandes liberais e a favor da liberdade acabam por fazer notícia sem haver uma proposta concreta, mas deixam já estas belas achegas:\n>a legalização permitirá um maior controlo sobre quem vende e quem compra, bem como sobre a qualidade e intensidade da própria canábis\"\nNão são a favor da liberdade,  são a favor de serem eles os controladores do que podes ou não fazer.",

Pero los diferentes gobiernos europeos tardaron en actuar por motivos políticos: la primera pregunta que a menudo se repite es \"¿Cómo se lo van a tomar los votantes?\". Hay que esperar hasta que haya muertos y que la gente se de cuenta de que va en serio para que el gobierno pueda tomar medidas como cerrar negocios.\nEl caso de las subprime no tiene nada que ver. Fue una estafa premeditada pero de una escala tan grande que dañó a la economía del mundo. Lo que todavía me fastidia es que esos criminales no fueron arrestados y que varios paises tuvieron que aumentar sus deudas para un bail-out de los responsables; evidentemente pagados por los impuestos de los ciudadanos."

Un tipo que renunció a la presidencia, fue traicionado por todo su entorno, que murió muy pobre, joven, solo y en el exilio, que le perdonó la vida a quien lo bajó del gobierno y fragmentó el país mediante un golpe de Estado, que dirigió a Colombia por muy poco tiempo y con su mano derecha asesinada, no suena muy a tirano. Fue el único que supo que Colombia por su geografía y por estar poblada por razas muy dispares debía tener un gobierno central autoritario. El tiempo le dio la razón y se la sigue dando aún hoy.\nBolívar es el único tipo que ha valido la pena en la historia de este país. Llegó la rata traicionera de Santander y creó la Colombia corrupta, elitista moderna y luego los federalistas y se la terminaron de cagar. Ni se diga ese punto medio entre federalismo y centralismo que aún hoy rige, qué porquería.\nEs curioso que la gente lee el rumor de que Bolívar era un tirano, llegando incluso al delirio de compararlo con Hitler, y solamente porque es una postura novedosa y en contra de la corriente la diseminan sin siquiera ponerse a pensar si eso tiene un poco de sentido o son simples burradas creadas por el antibolivarianismo que lideró el país por todo el siglo XIX, XX y XXI, o sea, a los que les conviene decir \"con los otros estaríamos peor\" para disculpar el remedo de país que nos dejaron. Solamente lo critican por egocéntrico, porque la mojigatería colombiana le enseña a los niños a inclinar la cabeza y a ser falsamente \"humildes\"; un líder arrogante como él es lo que necesitamos.\nSolo hasta relativamente poco, de cien años para acá, estamos reivindicando la figura de Bolívar y nos dimos cuenta que teníamos a un gran hombre y, como siempre, fuimos ingratos con él a la hora de su muerte. Jamás leí sobre una agonía más triste que esa."

      "post": "\\>La falta de tacto y la reacción negativa a un movimiento realizado por personas vulnerables no tiene ningún sentido lógico.\nNadie o casi nadie esta en contra de el paro per se. A fin de cuentas violencia es violencia. Lo que se critica es la postura discriminatoria que estan tomando algunas empreas y que exigen algunas dentro de el mismo movimiento donde se les da el dia libre EXCLUSIVAMENTE a mujeres (sin mencionar que es ilegal) mientras se les sanciona a los hombres donde se les ocurra faltar. Y tambien como al parecer, a diferencia de casi todas las protestas y paros en la historia, esta require trato especial donde el patron les de permiso para ir y si no lo hace pues atente a que tu empresa sea tachada de machista y mas cosas.\nAl igual como si se te ocurre decir que a los hombres los matan tambien, salen inmediatamente cietas feministas con su tono sarcastico \"hay pobrecitos onvres los matan otros onvres\" como si porque te mate otro hombre automaticamente fuera menos valido el reclamo.\nEn resumen, no se esta en contra de protestar por las muertes de mujeres. Se esta en contra de los dobles estandares que surgen, alrededor de esta protesta. La culpa no es de las protestantes y esto se tiene que dejar muy claro, sino de las empresas que se quieren subir al tren por cuestion de PR al igual que de ciertas radicales dentro de la protesta.\n\\> o cuantas personas cercanas a mi están en contra del aborto o cuán  estigmatizada esta la etiqueta de \"feminista\" ni la profundidad de la  desinformación de muchísimas feministas. \nEsto agradecelo a las radicales.",
      "reply": "Pero el problema de los dobles estándares y la crítica a las radicales (dejando de lado si se tiene o no razón) es una gran parte del descrédito que ha tenido el movimiento.\nSobre las empresas no se cuales sancionen a los hombres por faltar, no lo había escuchado. Esta bastante mal. Pero lo del resto de organizaciones que han dado luz verde a las mujeres para faltar sin represalias al menos yo estoy de acuerdo. Si yo tuviera una empresa también lo haría independientemente de si es por PR o porque comparto la idea obviamente me conviene que mi empresa actúe en favor de un movimiento que es mundialmente aceptado y no lo veo como un problema, el apoyo de grandes organizaciones tiene impacto en la forma en que la población ve las cosas. Es triste pero los medios nos mueven, si televisa hubiera sido feminista probablemente el machismo no seria tanto.\nY sobre las radicales que mencionas: obviamente un poco de sentido común ayudaría a hacer entender que ninguna muerte es peor que otra sin importar el género. Pero ese tipo de comentarios de que a los hombres los matan más no tiene entrada en la discusión sobre el feminismo y los feminicidios. Tantito sentido común también ahí. Para empezar Si viene un niño y te dice que lo están golpeando no le dices que a su vecino le va peor, lo ayudas. Y por el otro lado un homicidio y un homicidio con agravante son distintos. Uno es homicidio y el otro es un crimen de odio. \nEsa es mi muy personal opinión"

      "post": "Hace dos dias iba caminando por la calle y en la vereda habia un tipo parado en el auto gritandole improperios a una mujer que iba para la facultad. El tipo iba en una camioneta gigante de color negro escuchando regeton en la camioneta y llevaba lentes de sol unas cadenitas de oro y estaba todo trabado. \nLa chica en cuestion era muy timida y caminaba mirando el suelo con la carpeta entre las manos, llevaba una mochila violeta con el pañuelo de los derechos colgando, el tipo le grito: \"veni nena que te doy algo para que abortes\". \nInmediatamente senti mi sangre hervir al ver eso me acerce al sujeto en la camioneta y le dije al tipo \"Seguro tu mama te queria mucho\", el tipo se bajo de la camioneta con ansia pugil y me dijo: \"que te pasa imbecil nadie insulta a mi difunta madre asi\" y me largo una piña que yo con gran agilidad logre esquivar y me coloque al costado. La chica que ya habia subido a la vereda se reia y me alentaba mientras yo esquivaba las piñas del rufian.\n\"Te voy a matar nadie insulta a mi mama\" decia cansado. En ese momento le dije tranquilamente \"A tu mama la insultas todos los dias tratando asi a las mujeres\". El tipo reculo y se quedo estatico, luego se metio en la camioneta de un portazo y pude ver como sollozaba en la camioneta, probablemente por la abrumadora leccion que acaba de recibir.\nInmediatamente me acerque a la chica y le pregunte si estaba todo bien si necesitaba algo de ayuda, me dijo \"me has ayudado suficiente, siempre es bueno saber que tenemos buenos aliades\" me dijo sonrojada y se fue y despues de unos pasos se volteo y me sonrio.\nMañana la voy a esperar a la salida de la facultad a ver si me permite invitarla a un cafe.",

Resumamos los hechos:\n- En Mataró la cantidad de violaciones y delitos por parte de africanos (englobemos todo sin importar la nacionalidad) esta volviendo dicha ciudad en inhabitable por los mismos locales (ver prensa actual). Incluso en bares han tenido que contratar seguridad privada para echarles dado que roban al resto de gente, además de acosar a las mujeres.\n- Badalona, situación insostenible dado el crimen de inmigrantes africanos al resto de ciudadanos locales. Ver prensa actual la cual se ve como la propia ciudadania ha tenido que pegarle una paliza a un ladrón africano que ha robado y pegado a una persona mayor de edad.\n- Mujeres, el colectivo femenino que por supuesto no se atreve a decir nada por sonar racista, las cuales en ciudades como: Manresa, Terrassa, Raval de Barcelona, etc. No pueden salir por las noches solas, además de ser acosadas por el colectivo, mayormente africano.\nSeñores, vamos a ser puntuales. Estos son HECHOS que han pasado estas últimas semanas, pero que ya llevan pasando MUCHO tiempo. Curiosamente la prensa, por fin, las esta sacando a la luz. Así que no vengan a \"dar pena\" con esto de ser racistas, porque ellos mismos se están buscando que seamos racistas hacía este colectivo, el cual NO se adapta, el cual NO genera seguridad y el cual NO trabaja de forma legal en su gran mayoria.\nA titulo personal, nunca he entendido como un país con un 15% de paro, situación insostenible entre nosotros dada la crisis económica y que aún con estudios nos es difícil encontrar trabajo, como un país puede estar aceptando gente de fuera sin ningun tipo de educación ni experiencia? Un país no es una ONG y esto es lo que esta pasando en España, los cuales Cataluña acepta. Y esto es solo la punta del iceberg que ya muchos sabemos como solucionar, pero no se hace porque luego salen articulos que te tachan de racista por algo que antes JAMÁS había pasado.",

Le podemos pagar a un niño rata con un skin del fortnite para que nos escriba unos 200 comentarios.\n\n\nBot intermedio: Parecido a mi muchacho Marco, le implementamos un algoritmo de cadenas de Markov con comentarios curados de humanos. No me creeran, pero Marco ha engañado a mas de 20 redditores, asi que sin problemas puede engañar a la gentuza del twitter.\n\n\nBot avanzado: Ya estamos hablando de redes neurales, parecido a lo que hace Microsoft con el TayTweets. No creo que se necesite tanto pero es posible hacer bots casi humanos e indestinguibles de un usuario normal.\n\n\nDigamos, que sin problemas puedo tomar el dataset de comentarios de varios simpatizantes de AMLO de este sub y crear un mini ejercito de bots con un presupuesto menor a mil pesos.\nLo más caro seria comprar los proxies, son como 35 dolares al mes. Los combos de usuarios con passwords no deben de ser caros, con unos 100 la armamos.\nYa de ahi podemos usar Selenium o Puppeteer. Esto lo puedo correr desde mi PC normalita, usando un hilo para cada instancia de bot, claro todo con intervalos al azar para que se vea más organico.",

Para aclarar, la ansiedad que es endémica. que se vuelve crónica al punto de afectar la calidad de vida y la cotidianidad es alerta de principios de TOC. Desde luego que el diagnóstico de un siquiatra no va a declarar \"ansioso\" a un paciente sino con un trastorno específico como el TOC. También OP debería acudir a un profesional de la psiquiatría tan pronto como sea posible, porque así como su problema puede ser leve y no requerir más que psicoterapia, si es endémico podría requerir medicación psiquiátrica y cuánto más pronto esté medicado más rápido y más efectivo el tratamiento. Hablo desde la experiencia de ser diagnosticado con TOC y depresión crónica hace más de 10 años."

      "post": "Ufff, ni yo logro creerme lo que me ocurrió ya que soy muy analítico y no creo en esas cosas, ahí va mi historia:\nHace como cuatro años en el trabajo me encontraba sin hacer nada por lo que decidí buscar una serie llamada Afterworld que me encantaba y extrañaba por nostalgia, bueno... la busqué y la encontré, conforme iba avanzando en los episodios que duran 3-4 minutos recordé que la serie quedó inconclusa, me puse a buscar y encontré que no... la serie SÍ HABÍA TENIDO FINAL, habían N capítulos (no recuerdo lamentablemente pero eran poco más de 200) tuve que irme a casa y seguí mi día... así fueron varios días, recuerdo ir por el capítulo 90 'ish y una noche volví a casa exhausto, cené con mi novia (vivíamos juntos), tuvimos sexo y me dormí... el día siguiente no lo recuerdo, en serio. La cosa se pone rara aquí... día siguiente de ese inexistente desperté pero con una sensación de vacío -lo más cercano a lo que sentí, era raro- ese día no recuerdo ver a nadie en casa ni... pensar en eesperar a alguien en casa ¿? En el trabajo busqué la serie y repentinamente... NO EXISTÍA LA SERIE, EN SERIO, NADA EN BUSCADORES, JAMÁS EXISTIÓ, crei estar idiota por no saber buscar algo tan sencillo, digo encontrar en youtube que es donde estaba viéndola no era gran ciencia, pero como por default el historial se borraba cuando apagabas la computadora no había manera de buscarlo ahí tampoco, me saqué de pedo y algo me pareció extraño, me sentí diferente de una manera extraña, seguí mi día y noté que una chava con la que no me llevaba tan bien me hablaba como si fuéramos compas del alma, y me preguntó si jalaría a la peda del fin de semana... para no hacerla larga -sin albur- más cosas pequeñas ocurrieron que me hicieron sentir fuera de lugar, como que no pertenecía ahí, llegué a casa y recuerdo tener una sensación de extrañeza, que algo faltaba pero no sabía qué, vi tele, salí por unos tragos y volví a dormirme... solo. Fue al día siguiente que desperté sudado y mi novia preguntando que pedo, si había tenido una pesadilla, eso pensé, una pesadilla/sueño... pero fue cuando la vi que se me hizo extraño, el día anterior NO RECORDABA que ella fuera mi novia, de hecho, a duras penas recordaba su esencia ayer, en el trabajo no la vi ni busqué, como si no existiera ella el día anterior, le conté, se rió pero confirmó que era X día, habían pasado ya casi una semana  desde que comencé a ver la serie... llegando al trabajo lo primer que hice fue buscarla y a la primera la encontré, 130 capítulos (estos sí los recuerdo) pero quedaba inconclusa nuevamente, y eran como 50 u 80 menos de los que originalmente recordaba... la chava que comento ya no me hablaba como el día anterior, mi fondo de pantalla era diferente en mi PC, mi asiento, la mesa del café era de otro color y dicen era la misma desde que estaba ahí... es como si hubiera \"viajado\" a otro espacio-tiempo donde mi novia y yo no nos conocimos o ella ni trabajaba ahí, me relacionaba con otras personas y hasta la serie era de más capítulos. Suena bobo, pero haciendo análisis más a fondo, sí, ese día anterior es como si mi entonces novia no existiera, ese vacío que sentía la noche anterior era como que algo andaba mal, que algo dentro de mí me intentaba recordar que ella debía estar ahí pero no existía dentro de mi vida en ese espacio-tiempo... ahora estoy en otro diferente, porque recuerdo carajo que los capítulos eran más, que algunos que no me caían bien me hablaban, que un viaje que no recuerdo haber planeado ya estaba autorizado en el trabajo... \n&#x200B;\nPor más que intento analizarlo no doy con una respuesta concreta porque tengo memoria casi fotográfica y esos días fueron muy borrosos, de hecho algunos dicen me veía normal los días \"anteriores\", pero qué van a saber los de este espacio-tiempo si es otro...\nCasi no cuento esto porque sueno demente.",
      "reply": "Vi que te han dicho que quizás fue un sueño astral. Discrepo, me ha tocado experimentarlo y estudiarlo, más no hay indicios que indiquen una reconfiguración universal cuántica tal para decir que fue eso.\n&#x200B;\nMe siento identificado con tu historia, te creo. Cosas de esa naturaleza también las he vivido, no una, sino varias veces, sobretodo en este pasado 2019. Ahí te va lo que me ha ocurrido y lo que hasta el momento creo que es tras analizarlo:\n- Un día salí de mi casa hacia el súper a las 9:48 am, fuí por menos de 10 cosas por lo que no me pude haber tardado mucho, pensé. Me subí al carro, manejé de regreso y al llegar veo que llegué a mi casa a las 9:23 am. Ambas medidas las tomé de mi celular.\n- Compré unos tenis por internet de una marca no común en el país. Llegaron, abri la caja e inmediatamente saqué todo lo que incluía: Los tenis y una bolsa para cuidarlos del polvo. Guardé la bolsa en la caja y la caja bajo un otomán que tengo en mi cuarto. Pasan los meses (7 meses aprox.) cuando decido limpiar mi cuarto y doy con la caja. La abro y resulta que ahora hay dos bolsas iguales, una encima de la otra y una (la que apareció) completamente nueva. Tengo foto comparando las dos bolsas.\n- Mi mamá compro donas una noche. Venían en esa caja característica de plástico trasparente. Yo no suelo comer postres ni azúcar, pero esa noche decidí compartir una de las 6 donas que había comprado. Mitad y mitad. Me fui a dormir, me desperté la mañana siguiente para ir a trabajar y al sacar mi comida del refri me di cuenta que en la caja de plástico habían de nuevo 6 donas.\nTambién me he dado cuenta que cosas en mi casa se han replicado, como en el caso de las bolsas.\n&#x200B;\nSiento que hay de dos:\n\nSomos código, por lo que se pueden \"escribir\" estas nuevas cosas que se manifiestan por corrupciones momentáneas del código (todo lo que llamamos \"realidad\" que es un derivado de nuestra percepción al tener conciencia es moldeable, incluidos nosotros, el espacio-tiempo y demás conceptos infinitos). Glitches en la mátrix.\nLa naturaleza cuántica modificó lo que tú percibes como \"espacio-tiempo\" además de una dimensión escondida. Llamémosla \"Causalidades\". El espacio tiempo al ser tan maleable como la física relativista y la mecánica cuántica lo indican, sufrió una ruptura en su malla tal que esta vida que tú percibes fue absorbida por esa otra realidad que viviste temporalmente para esta percepción a la cual le estoy escibiendo este mensaje. La realidad es que este suceso que experimentaste no es tan descabellado y sucede seguido en el reino de la mecánica cuántica a escala de Plank. Sin embargo, a escala macroscópica es hasta 34 órdenes de magnitud menos probable (Px10^(-34)) que se manifieste. Viviste una experiencia que sucede una vez cada millones de años probabilísticamente hablando.\n\nEsto haría válido que todo lo que podemos vivir y exper"

Espero que hagan algo al respecto.  \nPor un momento pensé que esa cifra era culpa de los inmigrantes, luego me entere que la dirección nacional de empleos, de donde el DANE saca sus cifras, solo toma personas colombianas para las cifras de desempleo."

(Wtf lol) - no debería ser menos deudas mejor crédito?\nUn sistema para que el dinero siempre se esté moviendo?, o para controlar a la gente para que siempre esté endeudada? - no lo se, pero aun no me acostumbro.\nOP Como nacido en Estados Unidos, que conflictos puedes ver que nos topamos al llegar?- desde tu perspectiva.",

Sin embargo tanto él como el PRI tenían las manos llenas de mierda y estaban vendiendo todo y endeudando al país a una escala que ya me daba miedo.\nAnaya este candidato sin duda fue el que le dio el gane a López, muy joven para ser presidente con una cara de megalómano mentiroso con su risita falsa y la manera en como debatía que no dejaba a nadie hablar e interrumpía se notaba su deseo por querer tener poder tanto que para tratar de subir popularidad empezó con ideas socialistas cómo que quería hacer un ingreso básico universal entre otras cosas que no tenían fundamento económico alguno e incluso sonaba más loco que el López cuando dijo que quería dar becas a ninis. \nAMLO, se veía su pasión por querer hacer un cambio en un país que solo parecía hundirse cada vez más , llego con ideas nuevas, muy prometedoras pero incluso imposibles cómo acabar con la corrupción (si ahuevo) y se veía que vivía en su mundo al pensar que todo lo que quería hacer iba a ser fácil. Me daba miedo pensar que iba a tomar decisiones radicales sobre todo con países extranjeros. Se disfrazaba de izquierda cuando claramente es un conservador con ideas retrogradas. Mi opción era AMLO por qué los otros dos estaban palperro como diríamos aquí en el norte pero no vote por el por qué no quería quedar como un pendejo o que quedara en mis manos si este la cagaba. Me arrepiento? Claro que no por que claramente iba a ganar AMLO por la cagada que nos dejaron los otros gobiernos y como olvidaron a gran parte de mexicanos de bajos recursos . Hubiera votado por alguien? Sin duda. Si hubieran mejores candidatos. \nAhora yo te dejo una pregunta estimado, tu crees que con algún otro candidato estariamos mejor? Y si si por qué o en qué basándonos en propuestas de estos. Saludos",

La forma de aprendizaje es puro y duro autoestudio basado en actividades con escenarios o consultas extensas, una que otra videoconferencia para explicar la actividad a desarrollar durante esa fase y poco mas, si quiere acompañamiento debe consultar por skype o correo con el tutor o tutora y esperar respuesta, o coordinar en los espacios de atención para algo mas sincrónico.

      "post": "Hice la secundaria en dos escuelas. Una peor que la otra.\nEn la primera, como ya comenté en otro post, había florecido un remedo de mercado negro en los baños de varones. Relata refero, se podía conseguir preservativos, cigarrillos y porro y alguna que otra pastilla. El negocio lo manejaba un grupito que por lo demás eran buenos pibes, no se metían con nadie y actuaban con discreción.\nEn 3er año me cambié a una escuela más cerca de casa. El ambiente era más o menos el mismo, solo que sin actividades ilícitas. Por aquellos días estaban muy en boga los enfrentamientos entre colegios. En una ocasión un grupito de chicos de diferentes cursos se fue a buscar pendencia a un colegio privado de la zona. La cosa no pasó a mayores, pero las autoridades tomaron nota y se organizó una charla sobre convivencia y respeto, que naturalmente nadie se tomó en serio.\nDespués no hay mucho más que añadir. La parte académica la llevaba con holgura, tenía mi junta que a día de hoy seguimos en contacto. Llegando al final del secundario me moría del aburrimiento y le agarré un odio cartaginés a la escuela. Al salir del acto de colación armamos una hoguera con las carpetas y demás material que usamos todos esos años y cada uno siguió su andadura.",

La oferta me parece insuficiente. Pero no es un 16% para todo el año. Es un 16% hasta julio y después se vuelven a reunir (están esperando a ver si posta la inflación queda en 2,5% mensual o si fue solo una ilusión pasajera y van a tener que dar un 35%)\nNo creo que haya habido paros políticos contra Vidal, la provincia tiene paros desde siempre y Scioli arrancaba las negociaciones ofreciendo 3%... Bien hdp. Pero después de dos o tres paros te ofrecía 30% y no te descontaba nada. Vidal no solo los convocó apenas unos días antes de empezar las clases sino que les metió un aumento pedorro (como este pero anual) por decreto y encima como castigo les descontó los paros sobre ese salario pedorro al que le estaban dando aumentos muy por debajo de la inflación. \nEs ese nivel de hostilidad el que los llevó a odiarla tanto. Y para mí Vidal es una hija de re mil puta. Como hijo y sobrino de maestras nunca sentí tanta hostilidad hacia los docentes. Es horrible sentir el desamparo de tener un gobernante que no te convoque, que te de aumentos irrisorios por decreto y que encima te descuente los días de huelga sabiendo que al no convocarte, es la única forma que te queda de hacerte escuchar.\nTodo esto no quita que la provincia esté quebrada y que probablemente no se pueda pagar más, pero para los que apoyaban al gobierno anterior si la Mariu te ofrecía aumentos a la baja y te ponía mano de hierro sin convocar a los gremios y descontándoles los días de huelga había que bancarsela porque es lo que corresponde y además los maestros son todos vagos y bla bla bla que si no les gusta cobrar miserias que se busquen otro trabajo y listo.\nAhora si Kicillof hace lo mismo está mal, es una vergüenza, y los maestros se vendieron y se merecen cagarse de hambre porque algunos son K (en la escuela de mi mamá son todas viejas chetas macristas pero bueh)\nSiempre va a haber gente de mierda opinando forradas. Yo creo que es mejor escuchar a los que la viven en carne propia e intentar no juzgar.",

Yo llegue a este pais a los 15 años de edad, entrando a noveno grado. Practicamente mi nivel de español quedo en el nivel de un joven de 15 años. No lo volvi a tocar excepto con en comunicacion con otras personas, la lectura se limita a articulos pequeños de diarios de mi pais. y eso es por que es ahora poco tiempo que e puesto empeño en mejorar mi español. No hablemos de la gramatica. En fin, esto es un fenomeo que ocurre con la mayoria de latinos que llegan alrededor de los 15 años, nos empenamos en aprender el idioma ingles que olvidamos el español. Es horrible ver a alguien escribir mal, yo se que tengo mucho mas por correjir pero si hay esperanza.",
      "reply": "Lo mio fue algo similar. Llegue aca a los 10 años, es decir que solo estudie hasta 4to año en México. Mi uso del español termino a esa edad. De adolescente me propuse no perderlo e intento leer libros en español. Siento que leerlo te ayuda drasticamente, te das cuenta de la gramática correcta, de como construir enunciados, y del deletreo correcto de ciertas palabras.\nMi recomendación a quien quiera conservar el español,  seria que leean libros en este idioma."

A mi al final me toco devolver los audifonos y me reembolsaron mi dinero a la tarjeta y luego me dieron una giftcard equivalente al costo del envio, solo me pidieron que les enviara la factura del envio. Entonces \"tecnicamente\" no perdí dinero. Aparte de eso qie hice no se que otra cosa podras intentar :( \nPD: Como experiencia, procura que los productos que pidas sean vendidos directamente por Amazon y no de un tercero que venden con ellos. Como que asi es mas seguro que te envien bien las cosas y te respondan si pasa algo. \nQue te vaya bien!"

      "post": "Esta es una OVA fuera de la historia cannon de ya saben quién y creo que esto paso en el 2016.\nResulta que como un buen jovencito estaba esperando la salida de Pokemon Go! por suerte pude apreciar los mejores animes de los '90 durante mi infancia y entre ellos estaba Pokémon, no se que tan fan me podria considerar comparándolo con mi fanatismo por dragonball o star wars, ya que solamente vi toda la serie y jugué unos pocos juegos  (creo que mi juego favorito es sol y luna solo por mimikyu y mi temporada favorita es XYZ porque teníamos un Ash/Satoshi maduro e inteligente comparado a todas las temporadas posteriores, aparte de tener el equipo más hyper mega roto visto hasta el momento en manos de Ash, pero no fue suficiente, tuvo que pechearla contra Alain en la liga Kalos EN EL FINAL DONDE TODOS ESPERABAMOS VER A ESTE SUPER GRENINJA partirle la cara al Charizard X estereotipado de Alan y poder ganar su primera liga y no de manera meme como Alola). Bueno llegado el día de estreno de Pokémon Go! Agarré la bici y me fui con un amigo por toda zona oeste prácticamente, en mis primeros dias capture puras boludeces pero bueno era la gracia del juego, estaba tan viciado que abandoné el LoL como 2 meses y lo único que hacía era estar en la calle capturando Pokemones, el muchacho con el que jugaba a diario se cansó de jugar porque le salian pokemones malos o tiraba mal la pokeball o tenian poco IV, y bueno yo seguí mi camino de maestro Pokémon solo y tenía el mejor team \"petador de ogts\" de todo zona oeste me atrevería a decir, todos los gimnasios de mi localidad eran mios prácticamente (si jugabas y veias gimnasios con un personaje del equipo Sabiduría de nombre AlfaAzulSafiro era yo), tenía mi super Dragonite estereotipado, Gyarados(muchas horas en puerto madero o plazas que contaban con estanques en el GPS de Pokémon para tirar cebos), Poliwrath, Arcanine, Kadavra y un super pasado en esteroides Tangela(para ese tiempo era bueno). Bueno al estar solo ya se estaba volviendo aburrido y peligroso a veces (estamos en Argentina, caminar de noche en X lugares con el cel en la mano no es saludable) entonces baje aplicaciones de chat y encontre gente para jugar. Te preguntaras cuál es el punto de la historia? Resulta que una vez en uno de esos chats que usaba para hacer amigos de Pokémon Go terminé hablando con una muchacha, esta muchacha al hablar nos dimos cuenta que eramos de la misma localidad (genial menos viaje para jugar) y bueno era un tanto mayor que yo (6 años) nos reunimos  a jugar 3 veces, y bueno hace unas semanas le comenté a un random acá en reddit (como es normal comentarnos entre randoms) y me mando privado porque \"le parecía gracioso\" hablamos y bueno me dijo que una de sus parejas era coreana (por mi nick) le dije que me pase una foto para verla ya que si no esta en reddit daría lo mismo verla(? Me dijo que no pero que si queria me pasaba de ella. Adivinen...\nAdivinaron? Era la chica con la que me junte a jugar Pokémon y que vive cerca de casa.\nMoraleja: el mundo es chico, ojo con las cosas que hacen en internet porque puede leerlas su vecino.",

Por otro lado, siento que es imposible poder ayudar/arreglar/curar a alguien así.

NO EXISTÍA LA SERIE, EN SERIO, NADA EN BUSCADORES, JAMÁS EXISTIÓ, crei estar idiota por no saber buscar algo tan sencillo, digo encontrar en youtube que es donde estaba viéndola no era gran ciencia, pero como por default el historial se borraba cuando apagabas la computadora no había manera de buscarlo ahí tampoco, me saqué de pedo y algo me pareció extraño, me sentí diferente de una manera extraña, seguí mi día y noté que una chava con la que no me llevaba tan bien me hablaba como si fuéramos compas del alma, y me preguntó si jalaría a la peda del fin de semana... para no hacerla larga -sin albur- más cosas pequeñas ocurrieron que me hicieron sentir fuera de lugar, como que no pertenecía ahí, llegué a casa y recuerdo tener una sensación de extrañeza, que algo faltaba pero no sabía qué, vi tele, salí por unos tragos y volví a dormirme... solo. Fue al día siguiente que desperté sudado y mi novia preguntando que pedo, si había tenido una pesadilla, eso pensé, una pesadilla/sueño... pero fue cuando la vi que se me hizo extraño, el día anterior NO RECORDABA que ella fuera mi novia, de hecho, a duras penas recordaba su esencia ayer, en el trabajo no la vi ni busqué, como si no existiera ella el día anterior, le conté, se rió pero confirmó que era X día, habían pasado ya casi una semana  desde que comencé a ver la serie... llegando al trabajo lo primer que hice fue buscarla y a la primera la encontré, 130 capítulos (estos sí los recuerdo) pero quedaba inconclusa nuevamente, y eran como 50 u 80 menos de los que originalmente recordaba... la chava que comento ya no me hablaba como el día anterior, mi fondo de pantalla era diferente en mi PC, mi asiento, la mesa del café era de otro color y dicen era la misma desde que estaba ahí... es como si hubiera \"viajado\" a otro espacio-tiempo donde mi novia y yo no nos conocimos o ella ni trabajaba ahí, me relacionaba con otras personas y hasta la serie era de más capítulos. Suena bobo, pero haciendo análisis más a fondo, sí, ese día anterior es como si mi entonces novia no existiera, ese vacío que sentía la noche anterior era como que algo andaba mal, que algo dentro de mí me intentaba recordar que ella debía estar ahí pero no existía dentro de mi vida en ese espacio-tiempo... ahora estoy en otro diferente, porque recuerdo carajo que los capítulos eran más, que algunos que no me caían bien me hablaban, que un viaje que no recuerdo haber planeado ya estaba autorizado en el trabajo... \n&#x200B;\nPor más que intento analizarlo no doy con una respuesta concreta porque tengo memoria casi fotográfica y esos días fueron muy borrosos, de hecho algunos dicen me veía normal los días \"anteriores\", pero qué van a saber los de este espacio-tiempo si es otro...\nCasi no cuento esto porque sueno demente.",
      "reply": "r/AstralProjection\nMuchas personas describen experiencias similares, supuestamente con la proyeccion astral (AKA se te sube el muerto, pero controlado)  puedes viajar a realidades alternas, futuro, pasado, a lugares etc. Algo así como en Endgame pero mientras duermes.\nNo tengo los links, pero recuerdo haber leído varias veces que muchos/muchas han viajado a realidades alternas muy similares a esta realidad, notando desde cambios pequeños como la mesa, hasta cambios en status económico etc. \nHay personas aqui que juran que pueden viajar a otra realidad y vivir años ahí mientras en nuestra realidad solo pasa una noche. \nEn lo personal si creo que tiene algo de cierto, cuando era niño tuve mi primera proyección involuntaria obviamente no sabía que era, alrededor de los 22 hubo una época en las que tuve muchas pero aun no sabia de que se trataba ni tenía nada de información del tema aparte de que se me hacía ridículo pensar que era cierto. Y bueno hace como un año descubrí ese subreddit y la verdad me impresiono, me da un poco de vergüenza admitirlo pero creo que es cierto.\nLo que llegue a experimentar:\nSalir de mi cuerpo y empezar a caminar en la casa como si nada y tiempo ver mi cuerpo dormido, esta me paso muchas veces.:\nUna vez flote por la colonia.  \nVivo en USA, no se como pero me proyecte a casa de mis tías en México, quise interactuar pero no pude, un minuto después el tiempo se pauso para mis tias no se movían y la tele que estaban viendo tenia estática, y vi que había alguien en el patio, salí ver de quien y pues era un desconocido y me dijo \"no lo veas y no hables con el\" y yo asi de \"que pedo quien?\" y voltee a ver y había un hombre del otro lado de la calle, cuando lo vi el me estaba viendo y me dio un terror que todavía  recuerdo, despues de eso entre a la casa de nuevo, el tiempo seguia pausado para mis tias y senti que algo me estaba jalando y cuando me di cuenta estaba contra la pared, como si yo fuera un metal y la pared un iman. Despues de eso quede liberado de la pared y a la vez el tiempo comenzo a funcionar de nuevo para mis tias.\nCheca el subreddit y me das tu opinión, suena muy interesante lo que te paso."
