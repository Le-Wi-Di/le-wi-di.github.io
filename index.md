### 👍👎 LeWiDi
### LeWiDi third Edition @[NLPerspectives Workshop](https://nlperspectives.di.unito.it/) coming very soon! Stay tuned 👍👍
The third edition of Learning with Disagreements (LeWiDi) will be co-located with the NLPerspectives workshop at EMNLP 2025. 
Positioned within the growing body of research that critically examines label harmonization practices and the reliance on a single ground truth, this year's shared task challenges participants to leverage both instance-level disagreement and annotator-level information in classification. The proposed tasks feature datasets that address disagreement in both interpretation and labeling—with a dataset for Natural Language Inference (NLI) and another for paraphrase detection—as well as subjective tasks, including irony and sarcasm detection.
